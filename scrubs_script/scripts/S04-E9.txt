I.C.U. -- WARD
"In The Mood" plays on a record player as the elderly patients dance around.
</p><p>Patient: Doctor's comin'!
</p><p>The needle is jerked off the record and everyone flies back to their beds as J.D. and Elliot enter.
</p><p>J.D.: What the...?
</p><p>J.D. notices two pairs of feet sticking out from the covers of one bed. He pulls them back to reveal two old men cuddled in the bed together.
</p><p>Patient: Frank, you idiot. Your bed's down the hall!
</p><p>Frank: I know! I love you....
</p><p>Elliot: Ohh!
</p><p>BACK TO REALITY***
</p><p>J.D. and Elliot are at the NURSES' STATION
</p><p>J.D.: You ever get the feeling our patients pretend to be sicker when we're around?
</p><p>Elliot: Oh, yeah. You know Mrs. Wilson back there? She made her spleen pretend to rupture, and then she pretended to die.
</p><p>A body is wheeled through.
</p><p>Elliot: Got me again, there, Mrs. Wilson!
</p><p>J.D.: You know, Elliot, since I broke your heart, I've held my tongue every time you've been a wiseacre. But now that you slept with my brother, we're even. So if you bring sarcasm my way, baby, prepare to be stung!
</p><p>Elliot: J.D.--
</p><p>J.D.: So's your face.
</p><p>Elliot: That doesn't even make any sense.
</p><p>J.D.: "So's your face" always makes sense.
</p><p>Carla: J.D., that's stupid.
</p><p>J.D.: So's your face! I'm on fire! Helloooo!
</p><p>He leaves victorious.
</p><p>HALL
Dr. Kelso approaches Dr. Cox, walking through with him.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Perry, are you familiar with Sacred Heart's community service program?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Bobby, lately I've noticed you don't listen to a single word people say, so my reply to your question is I think you're the world's biggest jackass and I look forward to your death.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Well, you must not be familiar with it because you're the only staff member not to have completed his 24-hour mandatory community service. Consider yourself suspended until you do! Oh, and I'm never dying.
</p><p>He goes on.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh, guh!
</p><p>NURSES' STATION
Molly arrives.
</p><p>Molly: [pinching Elliot] Crab claw.
</p><p>Elliot: Ow!
Did you just pinch my arm fat?
</p><p>Molly: Yeah, does it make you mad?
</p><p>Elliot: I don't know, it was kind of a--
</p><p>Molly: [pinching again] Crab claw!
</p><p>Elliot: Ow! What are you doing!?
</p><p>Molly: I'm moving to Milwaukee for a psychiatric fellowship, and by pinching your arm I'm making you angry instead of feeling overwhelmed with sadness that I'm leaving.
</p><p>Elliot: [overwhelmed with sadness] You're leaving?
</p><p>Molly: Don't cry, you're gonna make me cry.
</p><p>A slightly deranged, shirtless fellow stops on his way through.
</p><p>Guy: They're here! Ignite the tractor beam!
</p><p>He makes a hissing noise and continues on.
</p><p>Molly: I should go, that's my 2 o'clock.
</p><p>She goes.
Elliot turns to Carla and the newly arrived Turk and J.D.
</p><p>Elliot: Oh....
I can't believe she's leaving!
</p><p>Turk: Hospital just lost its second-hottest employee.
</p><p>Carla: Don't think you can drool all over her just because you rank me number one.
</p><p>Turk: Baby, Nurse Tisdale's number one.
</p><p>Carla gives him a dirty look.
</p><p>Turk: You g--you gotta be single to be on the list.
</p><p>Elliot: You actually rank the women of this hospital by their appearance?
</p><p>J.D.: Calm down, Twelve.
</p><p>Elliot: [to self] Yes, top twenty!
Look, you guys, we should really do something for Molly, like throw her a party.
</p><p>J.D.: I don't know, Elliot. Molly and I really aren't that close.
</p><p>Cut to...
TURK, CARLA, &amp; J.D.'S APARTMENT -- EVENING
J.D. and Molly are making out on the couch.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Okay, a lot happened between that moment and this one. I should explain.
</p><p>Flashback to...
BAR -- EARLIER THAT EVENING
Everyone's there having a good time.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Elliot did end up throwing Molly a goodbye party.
</p><p>Molly: This is amazing, Elliot, thank you.
</p><p>Elliot: I also had a piñata made to look exactly like you, but I don't know what happened to it.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
TODD'S APARTMENT
Todd is putting the moves on the Molly piñata.
</p><p>Todd: Whoa, it's gettin' late. Big Dog wants some candy.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
BAR
Carla and Turk are at the bar.
</p><p>Turk: Yes, baby, Molly is attractive. But she doesn't hold a candle to my Puerto Rican princess!
</p><p>Carla: For the last time, Turk: I'm Dominican.
</p><p>She gets up and leaves him.
Meanwhile, J.D. chats up a cute girl at another end of the bar.
</p><p>Girl: My nephew Ryan is so cute. He's six.
</p><p>She continues talking but is drowned out by...
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: I was content to lay low and flirt in the corner. See, the most important thing about hospital get-togethers is to make sure you don't do anything people will be talking about the next day.
</p><p>A tray of novelty drinks is carried around to the other guests.
</p><p>Doug: Wow, look, flaming shots!
</p><p>He takes one, but someone bumps him from behind, disturbing his drink which lands on J.D.'s back, setting J.D. on fire.
The girl J.D. is listening to doesn't really notice.
</p><p>Girl: ...goes through like the whole day that he's grown up! Oh my God, I love it.
</p><p>J.D.: Will you excuse me a moment?
</p><p>She nods.
</p><p>J.D.: AAAAGGGGHHHHH! PUT ME OUT! PUT ME OUT!
</p><p>Doug: All right! Stand back, everyone! I'll handle this!
</p><p>He grabs a pool cue and begins whacking at J.D.'s flaming back with it.
</p><p>J.D.: OW! DOUG! WHY!? AAAGGGHHH!
</p><p>Flailing and screaming, J.D. rushes into the men's room.
Two seconds later, now totally aflame, he bursts back out.
</p><p>J.D.: AAAGGGHHH! The sinks are broken! The sinks are broken! Hot! Hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!
</p><p>He hits the ground and begins rolling around, where Turk hits him with a blast of fire extinguisher.
Finally, charred and foamy, J.D. pulls himself back up to the bar.
</p><p>J.D.: [nonchalant] So your nephew is six, huh? That's a crazy age!
</p><p>Cut to...
TURK, CARLA, &amp; J.D.'S APARTMENT -- LATER
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: After the fire marshal closed down the bar, we took the party back to our place.
</p><p>Todd enters with chocolate all over his face.
</p><p>Todd: Sorry I'm late. Player had a date. Anybody want some chocolate?
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Eventually things wound down. Some people went home....
</p><p>Many of the guests fade out.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Some just went to bed....
</p><p>Turk and Carla stumble towards their bedroom.
</p><p>Carla: 'Night.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: And that's how Molly and I ended up alone on the couch, watching that unbelievably romantic scene from '16 Candles'.
</p><p>'16 Candles<i> Long Duk Dong: The Donger need food!</i>
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: No, not that one! This one.
</p><p>'16 Candles<i> Jake: Happy birthday, Samantha.</i>
</p><p>As the screen couple kisses, J.D. and Molly also lean in to kiss.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: God bless Molly Ringwald. And this Molly. Ah, the hell with it! God bless Mollys everywhere!
</p><p>HOSPITAL -- PARKING LOT
J.D. watches as Turk stands from crouching next to J.D.'s scooter. They walk towards the hospital.
</p><p>Turk: Dude, now that I have adjusted your fuel valve, your scooter is going to fly!
</p><p>J.D.: Speaking of things that are fly, I made out with Molly last night. I know that was kind of a lame segue, but I've been with you all morning and you've yet to use the words "make" or "out."
</p><p>Meanwhile...
HALL
Molly and Elliot are walking through.
</p><p>Molly: I hope it doesn't bother you.
</p><p>Elliot: Nah. How was it?
</p><p>Molly: Weird. His tongue was freezing.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
FIRST FLOOR HALL
J.D. and Turk walk in.
</p><p>J.D.: I gave her the ol' ice tongue. It's easy to do, you just have to be really smooth.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
HALL
</p><p>Molly: He kept running to the kitchen to put ice on his tongue.
</p><p>Elliot: Ugh, I always hated ice tongue. And sometimes his lips seemed so greasy.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
FIRST FLOOR HALL
</p><p>J.D.: I'm telling you, Turk. Olive oil.
</p><p>Turk: Dude, just because it's good on salad doesn't mean it's good on your lips.
</p><p>EMERGENCY ENTRANCE
Carla and Dr. Cox emerge, Perry all suited up in a paramedic's uniform.
</p><p>Carla: I wuv your wittle outfit.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Now listen, you: Riding in an ambulance takes care of my community service, so I'm doing two shifts back to back -- I'm gonna knock this whole thing out in a single day. Besides, how bad can it be?
</p><p>The ambulance pulls up and a rather loud female paramedic, Denise, sticks her head out the window.
</p><p>Denise: Howdy, partner! Name's Denise Lemon. Looks like we got ourselves a little ambu-date -- that's "ambulance" and "date" put together. I got a million of those! [laughs]
</p><p>Carla: I am loving this!
</p><p>Dr. Cox groans.
</p><p>Denise: Hey, uh, hon, before you hop in there, could you do me a little favoroony and check the windshield wiper? I think I got something caught up there. Yeah.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: No problem. I got it.
</p><p>Just as he climbs up to inspect the windshield wiper, Denise blares the siren, startling him.
</p><p>Denise: [laughing] I always get the newbies with that one! [laughs] Got you! You know it!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [to Carla] When they strap me in the chair, please let them know the murder was just.
</p><p>NURSES' STATION
J.D. and Elliot are there.
</p><p>J.D.: Hey, Elliot, I was making out some prescription orders -- and speaking of making out--
</p><p>Elliot: She already told me, J.D.
</p><p>J.D.: Oh, damn, I was afraid that was gonna get out. [raising voice] Does anybody else know that I totally made out with Molly? Up here!
</p><p>He high-fives a staffer.
</p><p>Elliot: Now that you made out with my best friend, that makes us not even again. So go get me some cotton balls and a toe separator -- mama needs a pedicure! Heh.
</p><p>J.D.: Elliot, once you're even, you can't just go back to being not even. That ain't new, girl!
</p><p>Elliot: Admit we're not even or I'll make you pay.
</p><p>J.D.: Heh, yeah, now that we're friends and there's no chance of us ever having sex again, there's really not a whole lot I [air quotes] "need" from you, okay? So g'head and give it your best shot.
[hops on a passing gurney] Andele, Juan!
</p><p>AMBULANCE
Dr. Cox is riding shotgun to Denise.
</p><p>Denise: [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news I got a --
</p><p>She shoves her imaginary microphone at Dr. Cox.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Yeah, I'm not a big car-singing kind of guy.
</p><p>Denise: Aww, "Bad case of loving you," Perr! [bats him] Come on, where's the fun?
You know, you don't get this kind of rush on a normal job. You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't, you don't. You know what I'm saying?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: You're saying you don't.
</p><p>Denise: Well, Perr, sometimes you do.
[she gestures at a photo on the dashboard] Are you looking at my boy, Davey? He's ten there; he'll always be that age to me.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [looking out the window] Can't take my eyes off of him.
</p><p>Denise: I don't blame you, he's gorgeous! He looks just like his mama! I'm kidding! [laughs]
I wish we had more time together, I do. Boy, you wouldn't believe when we started school? First day he cried, second day I cried, third day we both cried -- not 'cause of school, 'cause we had a go-cart accident. Think it's how my nose got bent.... Who knows? Nose knows. I love words. Don't you love words?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I like "strangle."
</p><p>WHEELCHAIR RAMP
Molly is here, and J.D. has Juan run the gurney all the way out, where he hops off.
</p><p>J.D.: There she is! Thanks, Juan!
Hey, Molly. It's your last night, you wanna grab a beer or something?
</p><p>Molly: J.D., I have to tell you something.
</p><p>J.D.: Oh, no, did someone you know die from beer?
</p><p>Molly: No one can die from beer.
</p><p>A younger J.D., Turk, a buddy -- Shinski -- and a girl hang out in lawn chairs and an inflatable pool. Shinski's chillin' on the ledge of the wall.
</p><p>Shinski: Hey, yo, J.D., toss me a beer, man.
</p><p>J.D.: Comin' at you, Shinski!
</p><p>J.D. throws a can at the guy, a bit too hard, a bit too far, and poor Shinski loses his balance reaching for it, tumbling off the wall with a cartoonish scream.
</p><p>BACK TO PRESENT***
</p><p>J.D.: People can die from beer, Molly. Shinski didn't, but our friendship did.
</p><p>Molly: J.D., you just don't have that edgy mean streak that I'm attracted to.
</p><p>J.D. shoves Turk off the wheelchair ramp as he's walking past.
</p><p>J.D.: You were saying?
</p><p>Turk clamors back up.
</p><p>Turk: Dude, what the hell!?
</p><p>J.D. leans down and whispers in his ear.
</p><p>Turk: Oh, that's what's up. Go about your business!
</p><p>Molly: Look, I'm sorry, but I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people, and you're just too normal.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.
</p><p>J.D.: My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer." I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets, and no matter how much I try, I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.
</p><p>He pauses.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: At that very moment, I feared I had divulged too much.
</p><p>J.D.: Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure. And I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.
</p><p>Molly: Wow.
</p><p>She kisses him passionately.
</p><p>DR. COX'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM
Dr. Cox comes in, drying off after a shower.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Boy, I tell you what, there, Jordan, I'm sure glad that shift is--
</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, on the couch next to Jordan is Denise!
</p><p>Denise: Perry! I was just telling Jordan here about that sneezing attack that I had this morning. Was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?
</p><p>Jordan: [sadistically chipper] Yes, Perry, was it fourteen or fifteen sneezes?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: What are you doing here, Denise?
</p><p>Denise: Well, I heard that you were doing back to back shifts, so I pulled a couple of strings so that we could get the old band back together!
</p><p>Jordan: Perry! You've always wanted to be in a band!
</p><p>Denise: Get out of town! I just came up with that band thing!
</p><p>Jordan: Get out of town, Perry!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Heh!
</p><p>Denise: Well, laissez le bon temps roulez. Translation: Let the good times roll. See, that's what they say in New Orleans, The Big Easy. You know, that was my nickname in high school -- New Orleans. No, I'm just kidding, it was The Big Easy. I was a huge slut! I was, I did everybody.
</p><p>Jordan laughs.
</p><p>WHEELCHAIR RAMP
J.D. and Molly finally finish their kiss.
</p><p>Molly: Much better without the icy tongue.
</p><p>J.D.: I'll remember that.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Why would she lie?
</p><p>J.D.: Should we get out of here?
</p><p>Molly: D'you think you can handle it?
</p><p>J.D.: No. But you won't know until after.
</p><p>Molly: You just need to clear it with one person first.
</p><p>J.D.: Just tell me who!
</p><p>Cut to...
CAFETERIA
J.D. anxiously sits across from Elliot.
</p><p>Elliot: [laughs her head off, then finally...] No.
Oh, what's the matter, J.D., freezer got your tongue?
</p><p>J.D.: That doesn't even make any sense!
</p><p>Elliot: So's your face!
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Dammit! Walked into that one!
</p><p>CAFETERIA
The scene resumes.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: The key here is to not seem desperate.
</p><p>J.D.: Please, Elliot! Please let me have sex! She's leaving tomorrow!
</p><p>Elliot: It's simple, J.D.: I'll give you the OK if you just admit we're not even.
</p><p>J.D.: I am sorry, but that is one thing that will never happen.
</p><p>He leaves the table.
</p><p>Cut to...
ADMISSIONS
J.D. walks in to see Molly at the front desk engaged in a luxurious yawn and stretch.
</p><p>Cut to...
CAFETERIA
J.D. lands back in his seat across from Elliot.
</p><p>J.D.: Fine, we're not even.
</p><p>Elliot: Thank you.
</p><p>J.D.: But Molly just left, so you have to call her at home!
</p><p>Elliot: I'm not gonna do that. But, I will write you a note.
[pulls out her prescription pad and starts writing] J.D. may fornicate with anyone.
</p><p>She rips off the slip of paper and holds it out to him.
He snatches it from her and races out of the room.
</p><p>Cut to...
PARKING LOT
J.D. straps on his helmet and mounts his scooter.
</p><p>J.D.: Okay, Sasha, let's see what your new engine can do!
</p><p>He revs the scooter and zooms right into the wall.
</p><p>DR. COX'S APARTMENT
Dr. Cox and Jordan watch Denise play with Jack, who's ditched the gay sailor outfit for a tiny baseball jersey and cap (score one for Perry, obviously).
</p><p>Denise: So, little Jack's a baseball fan, eh?
</p><p>Jordan: He's two and he can't talk yet.
</p><p>Denise: You know what you should do? You should get him some baseball cards! I got my son, Davey, a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes. Never liked the gum, though. Gum's a weird word, isn't it? You know? Do you ever notice some words, you say 'em enough, they don't even sound like words anymore? Gum.... Gum. Gum. Gum! Gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gum, gummmm. Gum gum gum...
</p><p>She continues chanting the word at Jack, much to Dr. Cox's bemused horror. Jordan is momentarily lost silently mouthing the word herself.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh, happy day. She's blown a fuse. Mm. I swear to God, Jordan, I can't do it again.
</p><p>Jordan: Perry, it's just one more shift. Just tune her out and she'll eventually leave you alone.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Consider it done.
</p><p>Denise: ...gum gum gum gum gum. Gum.
</p><p>HOSPITAL ROOM
J.D. wakes up to find Doug standing over him. Understandably, he screams.
</p><p>Doug: [screaming with J.D.] Aaaagghh! Relax! At most, you have a minor concussion. Now I just wanna check your pupils, okay?
</p><p>He comes at J.D. with an otoscope.
</p><p>J.D.: Doug, that's for ears.
</p><p>Doug: [with J.D.] Ears! Right! I'm not stupid!
</p><p>J.D.: Where are my clothes?
</p><p>Doug: I sent them to the dry cleaners!
</p><p>J.D.: Aw, Doug!
</p><p>He pushes Doug away and gets up.
</p><p>Cut to...
PARKING LOT
J.D. emerges from the building in his hospital gown.
The Janitor pauses in his job of cleaning up the scene of J.D.'s little scooter accident.
</p><p>Janitor: You responsible for this head blood?
</p><p>J.D.: Look, here's the bottom line: I am currently in possession of a note that would give me permission to have sex with a very beautiful woman, but I have no way of getting to her apartment.
</p><p>Janitor: Then what are we waiting for. [opens his van door] Get in.
</p><p>J.D. hesitates, unbelieving of his good fortune.
</p><p>Janitor: Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go, go!
</p><p>Grateful, J.D. jumps in and Janitor rushes around to the drivers side and tears out of the lot.
</p><p>Cut to...
COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT
Janitor's van squeals to a stop; the door is thrown open and J.D. tumbles out.
</p><p>J.D.: What are you doing!?
</p><p>Janitor: It's been four years. How do you not get how this works? [laughs to self]
</p><p>The van screams away.
A coyote howls as J.D. dials the cell phone clutched in his hand.
</p><p>NURSES' STATION
Carla is going over a chart behind Turk, who's leaning on the desk. He answers his phone.
</p><p>Turk: Hello?
</p><p>J.D.: Turk, it's me!
</p><p>Turk: Hang on, I'm doing my diabetes test. Ninety eight, is that a good number?
</p><p>J.D.: Yes! It's good! You surgeons are idiots!
</p><p>Turk: Oh, I'm the idiot, huh? Well, guess what you were wrong about! [hissing] Carla's Dominican!
</p><p>AMBULANCE
Dr. Cox lounges in the back as Denise settles into the driver's seat.
</p><p>Denise: All right, come on up, Perr! Let's get this show on the road!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and hang out back here, just kinda get acclimated with this area.
</p><p>Denise: Oh, okay.
Hey, funny tidbit--
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Sorry there, D., can't really hear you back here.
</p><p>Denise: Ohh. Message received!
</p><p>She turns back to the front, and Dr. Cox sighs with relief. His bliss is interrupted by a crackle on the speaker next to him.
</p><p>Denise: [over radio] Hey, can you hear me now?
Hey, it's like that commercial. "Can you hear me now?" See, now, the only downside is that I can't hear you, so I guess I'll just have to talk for both of us. So back to that tidbit. Now, that's a funny word. See, I know what a bit is, but what's a tid? Tid.... Tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid tid. Tid. Tid. Tid. Tid.
</p><p>COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT
Carla waits in the mini while Turk tries to find J.D.
</p><p>Turk: [shouting into the distance] J.D.! We're over here!
</p><p>J.D.: [shouting from the distance] COMING!
</p><p>Carla: I don't understand what the big deal is. It's just sex.
</p><p>Turk: It's not just sex. It's sex with Molly! Any guy would kill to have sex with Molly. Hell, I'd kill to have sex with Molly!
</p><p>J.D. arrives next to Turk.
</p><p>Carla: That's it.
</p><p>She ignites the car and takes off in a cloud of dust, abandoning the two guys there.
</p><p>Turk: Sorry, dude. Where were you?
</p><p>There's another coyote howl in the distance.
</p><p>J.D.: I was treed by that coyote!
</p><p>Turk: You got your phone?
</p><p>J.D.: He took it.
What now?
</p><p>TIME LAPSE
Turk and J.D. run down the road.
</p><p>J.D.: I can't run in this gown, it's too loose!
</p><p>Turk: I can't run in these jeans, they're too constricting!
</p><p>TIME LAPSE
The guys continue running, now with Turk in the gown and J.D. in the jeans.
</p><p>Turk: Yeah, this is much better!
</p><p>J.D.: I agree, but my legs are cramping!
</p><p>Turk: You spent too much time crouching in that tree, didn't you!
</p><p>J.D.: I was kneeling on a nest!
</p><p>Turk: Just think of Molly, man!
</p><p>She's all spread out on the bed in some tiny lingerie.
</p><p>Molly: [breathless and wanting] J.D., where are you? J.D.! Hurry!
</p><p>BACK TO REALITY***
</p><p>J.D. gets a jolt of energy and sprints ahead.
</p><p>Turk: Now that's what I'm talkin' about!
</p><p>Cut to...
AMBULANCE
Denise slams on the breaks to avoid hitting J.D. and Turk as they scurry across the street.
</p><p>Denise: [gesturing to them to move on] It's okay.
</p><p>She picks up the radio.
</p><p>Denise: [over radio] Hey, Perr. I just saw an adorable interracial gay couple. Aw, just precious.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Lookit, enough of the squawk-box, all right? And just keep your eye on the road, whatta you say?
</p><p>She turns around to speak to him directly.
</p><p>Denise: All right, no more squawk-box. But, Perr, don't sweat the roads. I know 'em like the back of my hand.
</p><p>Not really. With her head turned and her foot still on the accelerator, she swerves into oncoming traffic, luckily missing moving cars, but smashing right into one parked at the opposite curb.
</p><p>Denise: [over radio] Ohh, Perr...I think I'm hurt. Well, not badly hurt, just a tidbit. Ouch....
</p><p>MOLLY'S BUILDING
Turk scans the resident directory while J.D. talks on the payphone.
</p><p>J.D.: Elliot, you gotta help me! We're in front of Molly's apartment, but her name isn't listed anymore.
</p><p>ELLIOT'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM
Elliot's on the other end of the line.
</p><p>Elliot: It's either...4G or 5G. J.D., this is ridiculous, it's 4 o'clock in the morning. Even if you catch her, she's leaving for the airport in like ten minutes.
</p><p>J.D.: That's perfect! That'll leave us five minutes to cuddle!
</p><p>Cut to...
APARTMENT
The door is opened to J.D. and Turk by a scantily-clad Asian woman.
</p><p>J.D.: Hi, is Molly here?
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: It's not my wife, is it, Debbie?
Dorian. Turkleton. If you come in, you have to take your shoes off.
</p><p>J.D.: Sorry, wrong apartment.
</p><p>He reaches in to close the door.
</p><p>J.D.: Konichiwa.
</p><p>Turk glances out the window at the end of the hall.
</p><p>Turk: Dude, she's outside. She's about to get in the cab!
</p><p>J.D.: Oh my God. I'll never get down there before she leaves! This is the worst moment of my life.
</p><p>Turk: Or is it the greatest moment of your life?
</p><p>J.D.: You're right. Gimme that gown!
</p><p>He rips it off Turk, leaving the guy in his boxers.
Heroic music plays as J.D. slides down a cable with the aid of the gown.
</p><p>Turk: Go get her, buddy!
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Hey, this isn't that scary. Uh-oh!
</p><p>He slams into a wall and lands in a huge pile of trash.
He staggers to his feet, stringy bits of garbage hanging off his head.
</p><p>J.D.: [feigning surprise] Molly!? Heey!
</p><p>HOSPITAL ROOM
Denise has been admitted, with Dr. Cox at her bedside.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Sorry about your collarbone. Say! I've got a community service form here, would you sign it for me?
</p><p>Denise: Sure thing, Perr. [he hands it to her and she signs] So, you gonna come by and visit me later?
</p><p>She hands the form back.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Denise, that's not very likely. And here's why: All you do is talk, talk, talk talk, talk, talk, talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk. And when you're not talking, I'm betting you're thinking about talking. I mean, can I ask you a personal question? Have you ever had a thought that you didn't immediately verbalize?
</p><p>Denise: Well, I don't know. That's a tough one, Perr.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Uh-huh.
</p><p>Denise: Oh, look, the window's open again! You can see the moon!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh my God. What happened in your life that made you so needy that you've got to fill every waking second by babbling on?
</p><p>Denise: Fine, don't visit. My son will come.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: And now we are right back on your son again. I'll be honest with you, I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get your voice out of my head. It is a very real concern.
</p><p>He leaves the room.
An EMT approaches him.
</p><p>EMT: Hey, did you leave anything in the ambulance?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Only my will to live, why?
</p><p>EMT: Then I guess this is your partner's.
</p><p>He hands a baseball card to Dr. Cox and goes on.
Cary Brothers' "Honestly" comes up.
As Perry looks at the card, Denise's words flood back to him: "See, now, I got my son a Ken Griffey Jr. card? Carries it with him wherever he goes. ... He's ten there. He'll always be that age to me. ... I wish I had more time with him, though."
</p><p>He turns back to the door to find Denise starting to cry.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: What happened to your son, Denise?
</p><p>Denise: [softly sobbing] He died in an accident.
Paramedics were amazing, though. That's actually the reason I became one.
[sighs] I really miss him, you know?
</p><p>He nods and hands the card to her.
</p><p>Denise: Thanks a lot.
</p><p>STREET
J.D. talks to Molly as her cab waits.
</p><p>J.D.: Molly, I think you should stay. I'm off today, we'll have an amazing time, you can leave tomorrow.
</p><p>Molly: I'm not sure that's a good idea.
</p><p>J.D.: Well, maybe this'll change your mind.
</p><p>He hands the note to her.
Turk takes the ride down the cable, but lets go before hitting the wall, landing right in front of J.D. and Molly.
</p><p>Turk: How's it going?
</p><p>J.D.: Pretty well. Nice landing.
</p><p>Turk: Thanks.
</p><p>Molly hands the note back.
</p><p>Molly: J.D., I think this note's for you.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: I think the easiest way to lose something is to want it too badly.
</p><p>She gives him a small kiss on the cheek.
</p><p>Molly: Take care.
</p><p>She gets into her cab and, once she's pulled away, J.D. finally looks at Elliot's permission slip:
</p><p>Now we're even!
</p><p>J.D. throws his head back in a guttural scream.
</p><p>J.D.: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>There's a spin transition to Elliot in her bed, smiling in her sleep.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Of course, it doesn't help if your friend is a diabolical genius. Still, when you come across a person who's lost something that really matters, you have to answer the call.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
DENISE'S ROOM
Dr. Cox has brought Jack in to visit her.
</p><p>Denise: Ooh, he's just such a cutie pie! Look at that! Have you ever had cutie pie, Perry?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: No, 'course not.
</p><p>Denise: I like it à la mode.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Okay.
</p><p>Denise: I'm kidding! I know it's not really pie! But I'll tell you, if it was really pie I would eat it up, I'd gobble it, because I love pie! [cuddling Jack] Oh my God! You're my favorite!
