<p>The following is a transcript of the <i><a href="/wiki/Scrubs" title="Scrubs">Scrubs</a></i> episode <b>"<a href="/wiki/My_Best_Laid_Plans" title="My Best Laid Plans">My Best Laid Plans</a>"</b>.
</p>Contents<p>[Kylie's Apartment]
</p><p>J.D.: *Kylie and I still haven't slept together, but I had a feeling her 
four week booty embargo was about to end.*
</p><p>Kylie: I have a surprise for you tonight.
</p><p>J.D.: *God, I hope it's sex. Or a pony. I'll bet it's sex because I don't 
see a pony.*
</p><p>Kylie: Wait right here. [She goes to the table to pick up a license plate 
that says "JD MD"] It's for your scooter-- What are you doing? [J.D. has 
stripped down to his boxers and is lying on the couch]
</p><p>J.D.: Nothing. I was just going to do a little laundry. I assume your 
facilities are in-building?
</p><p>Kylie: Why is it always about sex with you?
</p><p>J.D.: It's not! Look. Kylie. I'm just really proud of my abs. [He takes a 
look at his stomach and reconsiders] Or... ab.
</p><p>[J.D. and Turk's Apartment]
</p><p>J.D.: *Turk and Carla were having some relationship trouble of their own. 
But at least they were working on it.*
</p><p>Turk: Baby, I don't understand why we can't discuss this after The A-Team.
</p><p>Carla: Turk, a lot of married couples hit roadblocks their first year, but 
nothing's going to get resolved if we don't get our issues out in the open.
</p><p>Turk: Okay. Let's do this.
</p><p>Carla: Okay. What's bother-- [J.D. walks in]
</p><p>Turk: Hey hey! There he is! My buddy hit it and quit it, didn't he?
</p><p>J.D.: *Hell no.* Hell yes! Now if you'll excuse me, it's time for my nightly 
ritual. *Pleasure myself, weep and repeat.*
</p><p>Carla: See Turk? This is our problem. We're trying to have a serious 
conversation here, but you're more concerned about how your OTHER wife is 
doing!
</p><p>Turk: Okay, you know what bothers me? Every little thing with you becomes a 
big issue. You make mountains out of molehills!
</p><p>Carla: When have I ever made a mountain out of a molehill?
</p><p>[Flashback]
</p><p>Carla: Turk! If you can't remember to put the cap on the toothpaste how are 
we going to raise our children? You know what? I'm going to stay with my 
sister.
</p><p>[End Flashback]
</p><p>Carla: I guess I could work on it a little.
</p><p>[Hospital]
</p><p>Elliot: Okay. The patient is in shock so the first thing we want to try to 
do is assess intervascular volume. [Dr. Cox makes a buzzer sound behind her] 
What, that's right.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I know. I wasn't [buzz]-ing you to indicate an incorrect answer. I 
was [buzz]-ing you because I was bored and I just thought that might drive 
you crazy.
</p><p>Elliot: Ah, you're a wonderful teacher! Now stop [buzz]-ing me in front of 
my residents. It's unprofessional.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: You're right Barbie. Carry on.
</p><p>Elliot: Ahem. So, when you're dealing with cardiogenic shock, [She turns 
around to make sure Dr. Cox isn't going to chime in; he shakes his head no] 
it's best to start fluid resusita--
</p><p>Dr. Cox: BONG! [The residents start laughing]
</p><p>Elliot: Let's keep moving. [Dr. Cox walks away and encounters the Janitor]
</p><p>Janitor: You know, I don't really appreciate you messing with my lady.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Your lady.
</p><p>Janitor: Blonde Doctor and I are going to end up together. I'm talking the 
whole shebang. House in the 'burbs, Volvo in the driveway, dogfighting ring 
in the basement.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I guess it wouldn't be the first time the janitor got the girl. Oh, 
wait a minute... Yes it would.
</p><p>Janitor: You want to place a wager?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I do. But here I really have no need for a cracked thermos and two 
pounds of keys.
</p><p>Janitor: How about my van for your Porsche?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I suppose when I win I could destroy your vehicle and make you 
watch, couldn't I? Bet.
</p><p>Janitor: Bet. [Dr. Cox walks away as Turk and J.D. walk in]
</p><p>Turk: Alright. Give me all the details on Kylie.
</p><p>J.D.: Dude it was so naughty. We're kissing, right, and she's like "I think 
it's a little hot in here" and starts pulling down her skirt. *Oh my God, 
I'm getting turned on by my own fake story!* [Turk's beeper goes off]
</p><p>Turk: Damn you, ruptured spleen! To be continued!
</p><p>J.D.: *Thank God Turk left because I can't think about sex anymore. Luckily 
for me, there isn't a whole lot of temptation in a hospital.* [He looks down 
the hall and sees Molly in her underwear]
</p><p>Molly: Howdy, stranger. Do you still want me?
</p><p>J.D.: Yes please. [He runs forward to kiss her, but ends up putting his arms 
around air; the real Molly comes up behind him]
</p><p>Molly: Hey stranger. [J.D. screams and falls onto a passing doctor] Ouch!
</p><p>[Theme]
</p><p>J.D.: *So Molly's back in town. She definitely wants me.*
</p><p>Molly: [On the phone] Bye. [To J.D.] How you doing, J.J.?
</p><p>J.D.: That's J.D.
</p><p>Molly: Oh, right. I was just thinking of that Jimmy Walker sitcom.
</p><p>J.D.: Good Times?
</p><p>Molly: Not great, my sister had a miscarriage.
</p><p>Elliot: Molly? Oh my God! You look fantastic!
</p><p>Molly: So do you!
</p><p>Elliot: How's Milwaukee?
</p><p>Molly: It's okay. I'm just here to see a patient.
</p><p>J.D.: *Even though she did the fake forget-my-name thing, she's here for me. 
I think we all know there's no patient.*
</p><p>Patient: They've landed. Grab some blankets and all the canned goods you can 
carry. We're moving to the sewers.
</p><p>Molly: Apparently he's gotten really possessive of me. He won't talk to the 
new staff psychiatrist.
</p><p>J.D.: Molly, I'm sure he's not that possessive. [He pats her on the arm]
</p><p>Patient: Get away from my doctor! [He tackles J.D.]
</p><p>J.D.: Get him off! Get him off!
</p><p>Molly: Patrick, down.
</p><p>[Doctor's Lounge]
</p><p>Turk: [On his cell phone, laughing] It is so good to laugh like this with 
you again.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I'm on a break here, Newbie. Just tell your shiny headed roommate 
if he doesn't shut up his first surgery tomorrow will be removing that cell 
phone from his own ass.
</p><p>J.D.: Would you give him a break? He's talking to his wife.
</p><p>Carla: [Walking in from the hall] Has anybody seen Mr. Jennings' file? Oh, 
here it is. [She leaves]
</p><p>Dr. Cox: This just got interesting.
</p><p>J.D.: Who are you talking to?
</p><p>Turk: Rosanna.
</p><p>J.D.: Your college girlfriend?
</p><p>Turk: Yeah.
</p><p>J.D.: Can I say hi?
</p><p>Turk: Yeah.
</p><p>J.D.: Hey Rosanna. [As she's saying hi back, he takes the phone and throws 
it on the ground]
</p><p>Turk: Dude, what the hell!
</p><p>Rosanna: [While J.D. is stomping on the phone] Hello? Hello? J.D.?
</p><p>J.D.: This phone is indestructible! If it has a camera, I'm so getting one.
</p><p>Rosanna: [As J.D. is throwing the phone out of the window] Is anybody there?
</p><p>Turk: Dude!!!
</p><p>J.D.: Why are you talking to your college girlfriend?
</p><p>Turk: We're just friends!
</p><p>Kelso: Ahhh, just friends... I was just friends once with a Vietnamese girl. 
Long story short, I'm on the hook for sending Trong Tree Kelso to college 
and he doesn't want to go to a state school.
</p><p>Cox: Unlike you, Bobbo, Gandhi here is in a healthy relationship. I mean, 
come on, lookit. Even Jordan lets me keep in touch with women from my past. 
Give me a pound, my dawg.
</p><p>Turk: He gets me.
</p><p>J.D.: Give me a pound, dawg.
</p><p>Kelso: Does he know you were being sarcastic?
</p><p>Cox: I hope not.
</p><p>Kelso: Splendid.
</p><p>[Cafeteria]
</p><p>Janitor: Gentlemen. Crazy-Eyes Margo. I've called the Brain Trust together 
for one reason. I have to find a way to make Blonde Doctor mine.
</p><p>Randall: Burn down her apartment.
</p><p>Troy: I have an idea. But we're going to need a tugboat.
</p><p>Janitor: Tugboats and arson, that's all I ever get from you guys. We call 
this a Brain Trust. And I'm the one with all the solutions. I saved you from 
that eagle, Randall. I saved your job, Troy. And Margo, I found your birth 
mother! She was a tree person, remember? No, there's no shame in that. I'm 
sorry, guys, but I've had enough. I'm afraid I have to find a new Brain 
Trust. [He gets up and sits down with Doug, Todd, and Ted] Gentlemen. I 
don't want to appear selfish, but stop what you're doing and focus on me.
</p><p>[Hallway]
</p><p>Molly: So, you seeing anyone?
</p><p>Elliot: I went on a few dates with a guy named Rick, but then he met my mom 
and it all fell apart.
</p><p>Molly: She didn't like him?
</p><p>Elliot: No, she loved him. They're in Aruba.
</p><p>J.D.: God, I'd love to get with Molly.
</p><p>Turk: Dude, you're pretty horny for a guy who claims to be getting it on a 
nightly basis.
</p><p>J.D.: What are you implying?
</p><p>Turk: Let's just say a little birdie told me that you and Kylie haven't 
slept together.
</p><p>J.D.: Who?
</p><p>Turk: Nurse Birdie.
</p><p>Nurse Birdie: Well, you haven't.
</p><p>J.D.: I trusted you!
</p><p>Turk: Dude, it's been a month.
</p><p>J.D.: Oh really Turk? Has it been a month? Because time just flies when 
you're dry humping your way through three pairs of cords.
</p><p>Turk: Look. Kylie hasn't slept with you so what she's saying is that she 
doesn't want to be exclusive. Is she dating?
</p><p>J.D.: She did go to a movie with her brother-in-law.
</p><p>Turk: That's perfect. Dude, you can have your cake and eat it too. It's like 
me talking with my old girlfriend. It boosts my self esteem and I take all 
of this positive energy back to Carla. Now this is what you do: you go out 
with Molly and have a great time while she's in town. But once she leaves, 
you go to Kylie and you tell her you want to get your exclusive on.
</p><p>J.D.: That is the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
</p><p>[Cafeteria]
</p><p>Todd: So once you've got the hole at the bottom of the popcorn box, it's 
basically just a waiting game.
</p><p>Doug: And for the record, that technique does not work with hot nachos.
</p><p>Ted: You want to get Elliot, get in good with her best friend.
</p><p>Janitor: Who's Elliot? [Ted gestures over to the other table] Oooh.
</p><p>Ted: Trust me. The way I got my girlfriend in junior high was by getting her 
best friend to like me.
</p><p>Janitor: And how'd you do that?
</p><p>Ted: I posed as her dad so she could rent a car. I lost my hair in eighth 
grade.
</p><p>Todd: Tough break five.
</p><p>Janitor: I'm going in. [He walks over to Molly] Um. We should be friends.
</p><p>Molly: Okay.
</p><p>Janitor: Do you like vanning?
</p><p>Molly: I don't know what that is.
</p><p>Janitor: It's kind of my thing. It's like taking a long drive in a car, only 
uh... it's in a van.
</p><p>Molly: I'm still not getting it.
</p><p>Janitor: Could you hang on for one sec? [He turns to his new Brain Trust] 
She's an idiot.
</p><p>[Nurse's Station]
</p><p>Carla: Turk. I found your cell phone in the parking lot.
</p><p>J.D.: Four stories and not a scratch. What are you made of?
</p><p>Carla: You got three missed phone calls. All from a Rosanna. Isn't that your 
ex-girlfriend?
</p><p>[Another Nurse's Station]
</p><p>Elliot: So, what's been going on with you?
</p><p>Molly: I went to India for two weeks.
</p><p>Kelso: Ladies, this is a hospital, not the junior league. Let's break it up. 
And Dr. Clock, I feel as though I've been seeing less and less of you 
recently. We don't pay you good money to go hide in your office. Let's get 
out there on the floor.
</p><p>Molly: I moved to Milwaukee four months ago.
</p><p>Kelso: Welcome back.
</p><p>Elliot: So this trip to India sounds so exotic.
</p><p>[Hallway]
</p><p>J.D.: Hey, Kylie. I was calling to see how your day was going. [He passes 
Elliot and Molly and overhears part of their conversation]
</p><p>Molly: ...this ninety degree cave and sweat would just be dripping off our 
naked bodies.
</p><p>J.D.: Naked sweat drips...
</p><p>Kylie: What?
</p><p>J.D.: Um, nothing, Kylie. It's a new band called the Naked Sweat Drips. They 
have a great song called Perfect Breasts...
</p><p>Molly: ...And then I got so flexible I could put my legs behind my head.
</p><p>Kylie: J.D., are you there?
</p><p>Molly: You should come. [Elliot's beeper goes off]
</p><p>Elliot: Oh, frick on a stick. I gotta go. I want to hear the rest of the 
story, don't forget where you were.
</p><p>J.D.: Feet up behind her head.
</p><p>Kylie: Who has their feet behind their head?
</p><p>J.D.: A patient, Kylie. Horrible car accident. You gotta wear your seatbelt, 
I'm telling you. Even around the block.
</p><p>Molly: Hey. I'm getting out of here. Do you want to grab a beer?
</p><p>J.D.: *They say the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.*
</p><p>[Nurse's Station]
</p><p>Carla: I can't believe you've been talking to her.
</p><p>Turk: Now honey, is it possible you're making mountains out of molehills?
</p><p>Carla: Dammit!
</p><p>J.D.: *Still, sometimes, plans go exactly like they're supposed to.*
</p><p>[Another Nurse's Station]
</p><p>Elliot: You paged me?
</p><p>Janitor: Yeah, look. I made a bet with Dr. Cox that you would go out with 
me. And if I win, I get his Porsche.
</p><p>J.D.: *And the success of those plans can take even the most hardened men by 
surprise.*
</p><p>Elliot: [She jumps into the Janitor's arms when she sees Dr. Cox 
approaching] Do you mind? I'm trying to have a private moment with my man. 
[For added effect, she gives him a kiss on the cheek]
</p><p>Cox: Oh God...
</p><p>Elliot: I got lipstick on you.
</p><p>Janitor: No. Leave it.
</p><p>[Back to J.D.]
</p><p>J.D.: *And sometimes, even the best of men can go awry.*
</p><p>Kylie: So, are you coming over tonight?
</p><p>Carla: Hey J.D.
</p><p>Turk: Buddy, you should try that cake I was telling you about!
</p><p>J.D.: Actually, Kylie. I... I can't tonight.
</p><p>[Elevator]
</p><p>J.D.: *If having my cake and eating it too meant being with Molly, then 
nothing was going to get between us.*
</p><p>Elliot: [From outside the elevator] Hey guys, you going out?
</p><p>J.D.: Yeah! You should come with us! [He starts hitting the 'Close' button]
</p><p>Molly: That's the 'Close' button.
</p><p>J.D.: Oh no, it's the 'Close' button. When somebody gets close it activates 
a sensor that opens the door.
</p><p>Molly: Fancy.
</p><p>J.D.: *Oh no! She's got a pinky hold! Elliot's got the pinky strength of a 
rock climbing jazz pianist.*
</p><p>Elliot: [She opens the elevator door with her pinky] You're pressing the 
wrong button. [She walks in and knocks J.D. to the ground with her pinky and 
then turns her attention to Molly] I'm so excited! So where are we going?
</p><p>J.D.: [Shouting] We haven't decided yet!
</p><p>[Parking Lot]
</p><p>Cox: I gotta tell you there, Supercuts. I've seen a lot of crazy things at 
this hospital. I've seen smokers live to be a hundred, and I've seen 
triathletes come in here and drop dead at twenty. I've seen unbridled joy, 
and I've seen debilitating pain. But I never thought I'd see a jumpsuit 
wearing, van driving, vomit cleaning, no good confounded Frankenstein 
looking baffoon like you get a girl like Barbie.
</p><p>Janitor: I'm going to paint your Porsche mint green so it looks like my 
van's baby.
</p><p>[Nurse's Station]
</p><p>Kelso: Trong Tree, [He continues in Vietnamese; the caption reads 'Not until 
you get your grades up!]
</p><p>Carla: Whoa! Rosanna gets her own personal ringtone but I don't?
</p><p>Turk: Baby, I don't have to answer this.
</p><p>Carla: It's cool. I got the ring that matters, right?
</p><p>Kelso: Nurse Turkleton, I want to talk to you about these discharge-- [Carla 
knocks the papers out of his hand] We can talk later.
</p><p>Elliot: You need to come get a drink.
</p><p>Carla: Yes I do.
</p><p>Elliot: Janitor! So, did Dr. Cox pay up?
</p><p>Janitor: No! No! He says that he needs to see us on an actual date. In a 
restaurant tonight at 8.
</p><p>Elliot: Okay, meet me at Stanwick's?
</p><p>Janitor: Sure.
</p><p>[Parking Lot]
</p><p>Janitor: Sorry guys, I can't go clubbing tonight. Daddy's got a date.
</p><p>Ted: Aw man! I ironed my going out hair!
</p><p>[Bar]
</p><p>Molly: You know, they make thongs specifically for low-riders now.
</p><p>Elliot: They don't work for me. I still can't sit down without showing the 
whole world the crack of my ass. The other night, some guy tried to put a 
pen in it.
</p><p>J.D.: *Some guy... I never get credit for anything!*
</p><p>Carla: So you guys think I'm overreacting about this whole Turk thing?
</p><p>Elliot: Phone calls from an ex would drive me nuts!
</p><p>J.D.: *I knew how to get rid of both of them, but I can't do that to Turk.* 
[He hears a disembodied voice from his crotch]
</p><p>Mr. Peeps: If you don't do it, I will.
</p><p>J.D.: *Mr. Peeps? Why are you British?*
</p><p>Mr. Peeps: I'll explain later. Just lose the extra bitches.
</p><p>J.D.: Carla, go talk to Turk. Share with him your feelings. That's what he 
wants.
</p><p>Carla: Yeah?
</p><p>Elliot: Come on. I'll drive you. I gotta go to dinner anyway.
</p><p>Mr. Peeps: You're welcome.
</p><p>Molly: We should probably go too. It's getting late.
</p><p>J.D.: Oh, no no no. I just ordered two drinks. [Two gigantic drinks come] 
Here they are.
</p><p>[Hospital]
</p><p>Carla: Hey Turk.
</p><p>Turk: [On the phone] I promise, I will visit you soon.
</p><p>Carla: [She takes the phone and hangs it up] I don't care if I seem crazy. 
Please stop talking to your ex.
</p><p>Turk: Anything for you. You know that.
</p><p>[Stanwick's]
</p><p>Elliot: College was weird. I was so worried about being liked that I let my 
freshman roommate think we were dating for three months. We broke up at a 
sorority formal. Ah, nobody could snuggle like Daisy. [She looks at her 
watch] Didn't you say Dr. Cox was coming at 8?
</p><p>Janitor: Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon. [He gives the thumbs up to his 
Brain Trust at another table] I kissed a dude once. It was at furnace camp.
</p><p>[Bar]
</p><p>J.D.: *Okay J.D., you're a little drunk. And you know what happens when you 
get drunk. You get handsy. Now control yourself.*
</p><p>Molly: It's tough making new friends in Milwaukee.
</p><p>J.D.: [He's feeling up his own chest] *I said control yourself!* You know 
Molly, if people aren't getting to know you they're missing out.
</p><p>Molly: You think so?
</p><p>J.D.: I do. *I knew at that moment what would happen if I reached over and 
brushed the hair out of her eyes.* [Sequence: J.D. and Molly begin kissing 
and make their way back to J.D.'s apartment and start undressing] *But I 
didn't do that.* I should get going. I'm sorry. [He leaves Molly at the bar]
</p><p>[Lobby]
</p><p>Cox: [He sees Elliot walking in with the Janitor; they're laughing] Well, if 
it isn't marginally attractive and the beast. How did the Porsche drive?
</p><p>Elliot: Wait, why did we just go out if you already have his car?
</p><p>Cox: Oh, my goodness. He actually tricked you into a date. This is so very 
delicious and filling I don't think I'm going to be able to eat the rest of 
the evening. In fact, I honestly don't think I can have one more bite of 
your painful humiliation. I find I'm just a little stuffed. Will take my 
keys to go, though. [The Janitor tosses them over] Yippee!
</p><p>Elliot: You're unbelievable.
</p><p>Janitor: You're the only one around here that treats me like a real person.
</p><p>Elliot: What did you just say?
</p><p>Janitor: There was one other girl, a few years ago... Red Haired Doctor. She 
used to eat lunch with me. Until the other residents started making fun of 
her. They called her Janitor Lunch Eater. Not the most clever group. Anyway, 
I know that you don't think about me the way that I think about you. And I 
never really believed that you would or that you could, but just pretending 
for today somehow made me feel good... for a change. I'm sorry.
</p><p>Elliot: You know what, it's okay. I actually had a good time.
</p><p>Janitor: Thanks. [She walks away] Elliot.
</p><p>[Kylie's Apartment]
</p><p>J.D.: Oh, Kylie. I'm sorry. I hope it's okay that I stopped by. [She kisses 
him] What was that for?
</p><p>Kylie: I was thinking about how patient you've been with me. How right 
things feel. And then you showed up and it feels like fate.
</p><p>J.D.: Wait, are you saying that you're ready? [She nods and he strips down 
in record time] Awesome.
</p><p>Kylie: [She starts lighting candles] First, let me set the mood.
</p><p>J.D.: And Kylie, you're right. It is fate. Because I was out with this girl 
tonight that I totally could have had sex with, but it was easy for me to 
blow her off because I was excited to be with you. [She's stopped smiling] 
Why have you stopped lighting incense? It makes the room smell like Chinese 
rain.
</p><p>Kylie: You blew me off tonight to be with some random girl?
</p><p>J.D.: Well, she's not a random girl. I mean, I had a crush on her long 
before I met you.
</p><p>Mr. Peeps: I will kill you!
</p><p>Kylie: You should go.
</p><p>J.D.: *I was in trouble. And if I didn't play my cards right, I knew what 
could happen.* [Sequence: J.D. and Kylie start fighting; J.D. puts his 
clothes back on and Kylie kicks him out; he returns to his apartment, making 
several phone calls; he finally gives up and sits down on his bed] 
</p><p>[Parking Lot]
</p><p>J.D.: *See, that's the thing about trying to have your cake and eating it 
too. If you make the slightest mistake, you usually wind up getting 
neither.* [Dr. Cox automates the Janitor's van to drive into the wall of the 
hospital]
</p><p>Ted: We can fix that. [The van explodes]
</p><p>Janitor: [To Ted, Doug, and Todd] You guys are out. [To Troy and Randall] 
You guys are back in. Where's Margo?
</p><p>Randall: She's at a Ludacris concert with her birth mom.
</p><p>Janitor: I lose my van to him, and I lose Margo to gangsta rap. Bad day.
</p><p>[J.D. and Turk's Apartment]
</p><p>J.D.: *And really, who wants to risk something important, just for a silly 
piece of cake?*
</p><p>Turk: I did it! Cut off all ties with Rosanna. Forever.
</p><p>Carla: Baby, that took like twenty seconds. How did you do that so quickly?
</p><p>Turk: It was easy. I just told her I was married.
</p><p>Carla: You've been talking to this girl you used to sleep with, and you 
never told her you were married?
</p><p>Turk: She never asked?
</p><p>Carla: It's no big deal. Because if you're lucky, maybe you won't be married 
for much longer.
</p><p>Turk: Baby. Baby!
</p>
