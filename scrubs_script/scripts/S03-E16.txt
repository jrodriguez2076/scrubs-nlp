</p>Contents<p>DR. COX'S APARTMENT
Dr. Cox, unshaven and in a jersey, zones out on the couch.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: It's been two weeks since Ben's death, and even though he was Jordan's brother, Dr. Cox was having a much harder time with it than she was.
</p><p>Jordan comes in, flipping on the light.
</p><p>Jordan: Sweetie, are you gonna lie around on the couch all day again today?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: What am I supposed to do?
</p><p>Jordan: You know what might be fun? Cleaning yourself.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I'd wash up, but I'm afraid to go in our bathroom.
</p><p>Jordan: Why?
</p><p>He points at two women, Allison and Maddie (a Brit), as they come in from the back.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Jordan's best friends came to town for the funeral, and unfortunately for Dr. Cox, they still haven't left.
</p><p>Maddie: Since Perry won't stop using the loo without lifting the seat, I've started to use his sink.
</p><p>Jordan: Aren't you a little dolled up for the movies?
</p><p>Allison: If little miss co-dependent here doesn't get "shagged" every two days, she gets the shakes.
</p><p>Maddie: It's true. Look.
</p><p>She holds out her trembling hand.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: 'Course, that could be 'cause you're sober for a change.
</p><p>Maddie: Maybe!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [surprised] Mmm!
</p><p>Allison: [condescending] You silly. Are you still mad because we tried to fix Jordan up with someone yesterday?
</p><p>Dr. Cox growls vaguely.
</p><p>Allison: Scary!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh, God.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
HOSPITAL -- NURSES' STATION
Dr. Kelso and Ted are there, with Carla and Nurse Roberts behind the desk along with a few of their co-workers.
J.D. passes through.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Dr. Kelso was having a little female trouble of his own.
</p><p>Carla: Dr. Kelso, the sexual harassment around here has gotten out of control. Yesterday somebody asked Laverne if her boobs were made for walking! It's rude! ...And it makes no sense.
</p><p>Nurse Roberts: Paris and Nikki were not amused.
</p><p>Carla: You named your breasts after the Hilton sisters?
</p><p>Nurse Roberts: Other way around, sugar!
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer: Ladies, this hospital's policy on sexual harassment is well-established. Plus--
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: I'll handle this. I think what Garfunkle here is trying to say is that you should all take a second, think seriously about what's really bothering you, and then have a big group unbunching of your panties.
</p><p>They all gasp, offended, as he walks away.
</p><p>Continue to...
HALL
J.D. peeks out a door as Turk hurries through.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Every time Turk's in a hurry, I'm always tempted to jump out and scare him. Well, today's the day!
</p><p>Just as Turk approaches J.D.'s door, J.D. jumps out in front of him...
</p><p>J.D.: Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!--
</p><p>Turk obviously has no time to be scared, as he knocks J.D. to the ground on his way past.
</p><p>J.D.: Wooo! Ack!
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: The...reason Turk's in such a rush is because he's starting a rotation with the hospital's new attending surgeon.
</p><p>Follow to...
O.R. DOORWAY
Turk joins his gathered group of coworkers as the new attending, Dr. Grace Miller, exits the O.R. in slow motion, peeling off her mask and cap to reveal a pretty face and flowing blonde hair.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: So.... You guys my new residents?
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: I could tell what the guys were thinking.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: [wispy voiced] Oh! There's so much blood! I hope it doesn't get on my dress!
</p><p>Predictably, the vent below her comes on and she giggles, demurely trying to hold down her billowing skirt.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: I'm Dr. Miller. A few quick things: Don't talk while I'm talking, never utter the phrase "It's Miller time", and I don't like the smell of cologne in my operating room. Now, I'd like to take a minute to listen to any questions or comments that any of you might have, and then after this minute I never want to hear from any of you -- ever, ever, ever again. Anyone?
</p><p>They all stare at her, stunned.
</p><p>Turk: Uh...I'm allergic to shellfish...?
</p><p>Dr. Miller: Any other allergies? No? Great! You, and unibrow, go scrub up.
</p><p>Todd, sporting a unibrow, steps forward.
</p><p>Turk: Wht?
</p><p>Todd: My waxer's in the Bahamas.
</p><p>Turk: Get a new one!
</p><p>ADMISSIONS
Dr. Cox (dressed at least, but still not shaved), Jordan, and Jordan's friends enter. J.D.'s at the front desk.
</p><p>Jordan: Okay, why don't you show the girls around while I'm in my board meeting.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Love to. Newbie? I've got a job for you.
</p><p>J.D. turns to them.
</p><p>Jordan: No, no. No pawning them off on Radar. They want the big-boy tour.
</p><p>Dr. Cox sighs.
</p><p>Allison: [flirting with J.D.] Hey, I've been sharing a guest room with razor-knees, here, for the last two weeks. Do you have a queen bed?
</p><p>J.D.: Well, it would be "queen" if I took my "cwothes" off it.
</p><p>Maddie: Ooh, he's quick. [to Jordan] What's he like in the sack?
</p><p>Jordan: Quicker.
</p><p>Allison: Oh.
</p><p>J.D.: [fearful] May I be excused?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: You move, you die!
</p><p>Jordan: [to Cox] Be nice to my friends. [kisses him] Bye.
</p><p>Allison: Bye.
</p><p>Jordan: Bye.
</p><p>She goes down the hall to her meeting.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Okay! [claps] Here's the tour: This is where the patients enter, upstairs is where they go to die, and down in the basement is where we slide their cold, dead bodies into the wall. Oh, and that's the gift shop.
</p><p>Maddie: Where can one get a nice gin and tonic?
</p><p>J.D.: You know, down the street on the right, they'll make an appletini that'll knock your socks off.
</p><p>Maddie: [to Allison] Right! Let's go and get drunk before pilates!
</p><p>They go back out the front door, and Dr. Cox whimpers vaguely as he heads down the hall, J.D. following along.
</p><p>J.D.: So, uh, Jordan seems to be doing pretty well.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: You know Jordan, she is a rock.
</p><p>J.D.: How 'bout you? How you holding up?
</p><p>Dr. Cox hits the button for the elevator, with no comment.
</p><p>J.D.: I...I know it's been kind of tough with Ben dying.
</p><p>Still no comment, Dr. Cox impatiently jabs the button again.
</p><p>J.D.: Are you gonna talk ever?
</p><p>The elevator arrives, and they step in.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Let me go ahead and tee this up for you, there, Annika: We are all going to die someday. For the lucky few of us it'll be nice and fast. But for most of us it'll be just as long and slow and painful as a conversation with you.
</p><p>J.D.: That's a beautiful sentiment.
</p><p>The door finally closes.
</p><p>CAFETERIA
Turk, Elliot, and Todd are at a table together. Dr. Miller enters the cafeteria.
</p><p>Todd: Hot Doc, 3 o'clock!
</p><p>Turk and Elliot look to their left.
</p><p>Todd: I mean 5 o'clock!
</p><p>They look back over their left shoulders.
</p><p>Todd: [pointing] Over there!
</p><p>They finally spot Dr. Miller over their right shoulders as she approaches.
</p><p>Turk: [quietly, before she arrives] Todd. Todd, let's get off on the right foot.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: Hey! It might just be 'cause my expectations are low, but you guys did not suck in surgery yesterday.
</p><p>Todd: Well, as long as your expectations are low, maybe we should have sex!
</p><p>Turk: [thumbs up] Perfect.
</p><p>Dr. Miller leans in close to Todd.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: I'm concerned about you. I think you hold us women responsible for the fact that your mommy didn't pay attention to you, and if you don't get help, you'll eventually start picking up prostitutes and killing them.
</p><p>Elliot: [laughing] I've always wanted to say that to him!
</p><p>Dr. Miller: Welp, now you don't have to! Ha-ha-ha!
</p><p>She continues on her way.
</p><p>Todd: She just talked to me like I'm an idiot.
</p><p>Turk: Hot chick, 12 o'clock.
</p><p>Todd's eyes fly up to the ceiling.
</p><p>Elliot: Wow.
</p><p>Turk: I know.
</p><p>NURSES' STATION
Carla is working. Dr. Kelso arrives, with Ted in tow.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Nurse Espinosa, it's been brought to my attention that there's been some inappropriate behavior lately.
</p><p>Carla: I know. _I_ brought it to your attention.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Anyway, it occurred to me that we can't allow this to continue.
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer: It occurred to _you_ because _I_ researched case studies detailing the hospital's liability instead of going to single's night at the Korean church by my house!
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Ted's sad life aside, I have decided that you are going to run a sexual harassment seminar.
</p><p>Carla: No one's gonna show up for that!
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: It isn't optional. Anyone gets more than three complaints here in the box--
</p><p>Ted puts a sturdy metal lock-box on the desk.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: --then they have to attend.
</p><p>The Janitor, a Korean young lady on his arm, strolls past.
</p><p>Janitor: Teddy! {Korean}
Subtitle: Teddy, we missed you last night.
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer: {Korean}
Subtitle: Shut up.
</p><p>Kelso and Carla look at him incredulously.
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer: What? He's baitin' me.
</p><p>I.C.U.
Dr. Cox finishes treating a patient and pulls back the privacy curtain to be met face-to-face with J.D.
</p><p>J.D.: Seriously, how are you?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh, my God. Look, Abby, I didn't write to you asking for help. So, if you continue on down this road, you're going to end up eating, breathing, and relieving yourself through a tube of some kind. Signed, Dealing With It On His Own in Kansas.
</p><p>He walks over to the Nurses' Station to sign a chart.
</p><p>J.D.: I wrote Dear Abby once in seventh grade 'cause I didn't have body hair like the other guys? By the time her response came out in Parade magazine, it was like a forest down there. Well, you know, "nothing ventured..."
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [eyes darting] Looking for streamers and a--and a marching band, because this will be the ceremonial one-millionth time I've had to shake off something that you've said.
</p><p>He shakes his head wildly.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Ahh. Yes, Newbie, I'm having a tough day. And of course I'd love to head home, but Jordan's satanic brood has taken over my apartment and no man in his right mind would dare enter that place.
</p><p>He leaves, and J.D. stares off into space in thought.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Hmmm.... I should probably go to his place....
</p><p>O.R. -- SCRUB ROOM
Turk and Todd are scrubbing up. Turk looks over at Todd, who flexes his fingers in the air.
</p><p>Turk: Agility exercises?
</p><p>Todd: No. I'm air-fondling Dr. Miller's boobies. Who's with me?
</p><p>He holds up his hand for a high five, which Turk ignores.
</p><p>Todd: No? Eh.
</p><p>Turk: Why don't you lay off Dr. Miller? And don't say "I'd like to lay _on_ Dr. Miller."
</p><p>Todd: High-five later for reading my mind!
</p><p>Turk: You know, I don't think you're stupid, Todd.... Even though you're washing your hands with your gloves already on.
</p><p>Todd looks at his hands. Turk's right -- gloves already on.
</p><p>Todd: Dammit!
</p><p>Turk: But keep your mouth shut, okay?
</p><p>Dr. Miller comes to the door.
</p><p>Turk: It's hard for Dr. Miller being a female surgeon around here.
</p><p>Finally she makes her presence known.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: All right. All those who are assisting me today, step forward.
</p><p>Finished scrubbing, the two step forward.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: [to Todd] Uh-uh, not so fast, beer-bong. You're out.
</p><p>Turk grins cockily at Todd as he goes into the operating room.
</p><p>DR. COX'S APARTMENT -- GUEST ROOM
J.D. opens the door...
</p><p>J.D.: Hello? The door was open--
</p><p>...and finds Allison and Maddie in a state of partial dress. They don't seem bothered in the slightest by his presence, and turn to face him.
His jaw drops and he stares momentarily before having the presence of mind to be a gentleman.
</p><p>J.D.: [covering eyes] Oh, God! I'm sorry! I'm very sorry! [sort of peeking] I just came to--to tell you both that I-I think it would be better for Dr. Cox emotionally if--if you two would--would leave. Okay? Thank you.
</p><p>He turns for the door.
</p><p>Maddie: Just a second, darling.
</p><p>J.D.: Uhhh, um.
</p><p>They come closer and close the door.
</p><p>Maddie: Of course, we will leave, but before we go, Allie could really use a man's opinion.
</p><p>Allison: Does this bra make my boobs look real?
</p><p>J.D.: Ohh, yes.
</p><p>Allison: Damn. Let's switch.
</p><p>They reach for their bra clasps.
</p><p>J.D.: No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no switchies. I think we should all be happy with the bras God gave us! I really should go.
</p><p>Maddie: Oh, it's all right. We were going to go to the gym, but I could just as easily throw up instead.
</p><p>Allison: Or you could just give us a work-out right here.
</p><p>J.D.: Uhh....
</p><p>They push him down on the bed.
</p><p>J.D.: I guess I could hang for a smidge.
</p><p>They kneel over him.
</p><p>Maddie: Good. 'Cause we've got something to tell you. Right, Allie?
</p><p>Allison: [darkly] How dare you tell us to leave our best friend's house because you want to kiss Perry's ass.
</p><p>J.D.: You know...ladies...I'm not usually into the rough stuff, but.... Oooooh.
</p><p>J.D.: [eyes closed and squirming] You shall not feast on me!
</p><p>Maddie: I'm bored with this.
</p><p>Allison: So am I.
</p><p>They get up and leave the room.
</p><p>HOSPITAL -- NURSES' STATION
Todd stands there as Carla counts out the complaints in the box.
</p><p>Carla: Thirty four, thirty five, thirty six.... Todd, you have thirty seven complaints of sexual harassment!
</p><p>He pumps his fist proudly and walks off.
Dr. Kelso comes over.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: See! It's working! Well, good luck with the seminar.
</p><p>Carla: Oh! Dr. Kelso, you have five.
</p><p>She holds them up.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Oh, I know! I put those in myself to prove a point. If you'll notice, all the "Kelso"s are written with a lower-case "K".
</p><p>Carla: No, they're not.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Well, it was worth a shot. There must be some loophole for me.... Where's Ted?
</p><p>Meanwhile...
KOREAN CHURCH
Ted stands before a group of young Asian women, a drink and Korean pastry in hand.
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer: Great service by Reverend Kim today, huh! So, you ladies doing anything after? 
</p><p>They stare at him blankly as he dunks his pastry.
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer: 'Cause I'm not.
</p><p>He takes a bite.
</p><p>O.R.
Turk is here, alone, dancing to M.V.P. &amp; Stagga Lee's "Roc Ya Body, Mic Check, 1, 2".
</p><p>Dr. Miller comes in and shuts off the music.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: There's no music in my O.R., Hammer.
</p><p>Turk: First of all, Hammer dance like this:
[dancing] Uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Hammertime!
Second, I got your back, so why don't you cut me a little slack?
</p><p>Dr. Miller: You have my back?
</p><p>Turk: Anybody gives you any trouble, and I'll handle the guy.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: 'Cause, uh, little ol' me can't.
</p><p>Turk: Well, I didn't mean it that way.
</p><p>Dr. Miller: You know what's worse than the basic knuckle-dragging scalpel jocks I usually work with? You. You are the worst kind of sexist. You're one of the sneaky ones who prides himself on saying all the right things when, deep down, what you really think is that I'm just a little girl who needs protecting.
Now I would appreciate it if you would apologize.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Sometimes it seems like men and women speak a completely different language.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
LECTURE ROOM
Carla stands at the front to begin her seminar.
</p><p>Carla: Okay. I think you all know why you're here.
</p><p>Her pupils, Dr. Kelso and The Todd sit next to each other.
</p><p>Todd: Player! Check it!
</p>
