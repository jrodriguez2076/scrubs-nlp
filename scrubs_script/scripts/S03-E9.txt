<p>The following is a transcript of the <i><a href="/wiki/Scrubs" title="Scrubs">Scrubs</a></i> episode <b>"<a href="/wiki/My_Rule_of_Thumb" title="My Rule of Thumb">My Rule of Thumb</a>"</b>.
</p>Contents<p>HOSPITAL -- ADMISSIONS
J.D. stands idly, watching his co-workers.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: At Sacred Heart, there are certain things you can always count on. Dr. Kelso will systematically break Ted's spirit...
</p><p>Dr. Kelso approaches Ted the Lawyer.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Oh, Ted. I meant to tell you eight months ago, all those days of vacation you saved up expire [looks at watch] riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight...now!
</p><p>Lawyer: But sir! I was going to visit The Alamo with the guys from my public sp--...speaking class!
</p><p>Dr. Kelso chuckles and walks away.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: ...Turk will start a fight with Carla that he'll inevitably lose...
</p><p>HALL OFF ADMISSIONS
Carla and Turk bicker.
</p><p>Turk: I don't understand it. This wedding is supposed to be about us -- how come I can't be comfortable?
</p><p>Carla: And I don't know how many times I have to tell you that you are not wearing sweats! 
</p><p>Turk: All right, fine! I don't have to wear sweats, I'll wear the slacks! But you know what? I'm also wearing the cape, and we gonna have a wind machine, and I'ma be standing on the altar like, "I DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
</p><p>She turns around to the passing staffers and shouts over Turk's theatrics:
</p><p>Carla: I'm marrying this! This is gonna be my husband!
</p><p>Turk: Holler!
</p><p>OUT FRONT
Elliot stands against the wall, talking on her cell phone.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: ...Sean and Elliot will do whatever they can to keep their long-distance relationship going...
</p><p>Elliot: [on phone] I love the new camera phone you got us. ... Really?
</p><p>She checks that the coast is clear and sticks the phone under her shirt, snapping a pic.
</p><p>Elliot: [on phone] Did you get it? ... No?
</p><p>Meanwhile...
STREET
</p><p>A guy walks along and checks the incoming message to his phone. He's visibly pleased, and in his distraction walks right into the telephone pole in front of him.
</p><p>Back to...
HOSPITAL -- ADMISSIONS
The Janitor approaches J.D.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: ...And the janitor will think of new ways to torture me.
</p><p>Janitor: Hey. Don't open your locker for the next couple of days.
</p><p>J.D.: Why?
</p><p>J.D. opens his locker, and a karate midget pops out, punching J.D. in the crotch.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Still, all you need to break the pattern is for something shocking to happen. Like, say, Dr. Cox being in a good mood.
</p><p>Dr. Cox wheels his patient in, stopping at the front desk.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: You know, Kyle(?), after three long years of watching you climb that transplant list, I finally have a liver with your name on it.
</p><p>He turns to the staffer behind the desk.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Check Mr. Iverson into Sacred Heart for the last time, will ya?
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: You see, when Dr. Cox is in a good mood, well, it flows out of him like a cool breeze that lifts the spirits of everyone it touches.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [thick Scottish brogue] Ohhh, it's gon'ta be a great day-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-heyyy....!
</p><p>It spreads to the bickering Carla and Turk, who jump each other in renewed passion; it spreads to the janitor, who kisses his mop and dances around; it spreads to Elliot, who is having trouble with her phone, turning her "frick!"s to giggles; and it spreads to Ted, who is up on the roof, just about to jump....
</p><p>Lawyer: Not today! Life's too good!
</p><p>Down below, Dr. Kelso stands watching:
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Chicken.
</p><p>I.C.U. -- NURSES' STATION
Carla stands by, anxiously looking at her watch. Dr. Cox is next to her, going over a chart.
</p><p>Carla: [exasperated] Come on, Turk! I got two minutes left on my break, how long is this surgery gonna take?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Carla, cut the guy some slack. Surgery is not as easy as it looks. I mean, he's gotta make the incision, cut the wrong artery, panic, collapse into a ball of tears in the corner, and after all that he's gotta go wash up, check the board, and find out who he'll be killing after lunch. It's...a grind.
</p><p>Carla: You know, you're always taking shots at Turk, but you've never really told me what you think of him as a person.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Me-me-me-me, me-me-me-me-meeee. Ah, there's the right pitch. Um, I think that---
</p><p>Her beeper goes off, she looks at it.
</p><p>Carla: Oh, hold that thought.
</p><p>She rushes off, and Cox turns to see the newly arrived Turk.
</p><p>Turk: I would _love_ to hear what you have to say.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I don't think so, there, bowling ball.
</p><p>Turk: Well, you might as well spill it -- Carla tells me everything. Except, of course, about that curling iron you have in your locker. [gasps melodramatically] It slipped!
</p><p>He pantomimes casting a fishing line, catching his "slip", and reeling it back into his mouth.
</p><p>Turk: It's back!
Look, if it makes it easier, you can just pretend I'm Carla.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I can totally do this.
Carla.
</p><p>Turk: [mimicking Carla] Wha-at?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I think that your fiancé is a self-involved, bobble-headed jock itch who is not good enough for you. Not now, not ever.
</p><p>Point made, he walks away with a satisfied groan.
</p><p>HALL
Elliot and Carla walk along to a patient's room.
</p><p>Elliot: Carla, if your wedding ceremony's gonna be in Spanish, then how will I know that you're officially married?
</p><p>Carla: Because all my cousins will throw tortillas in the air and fire their guns.
</p><p>Elliot: Really?
</p><p>Carla rolls her eyes and goes into the room.
Elliot lags slightly before following after.
</p><p>Elliot: God, I wish I was ethnic!
</p><p>Follow to...
PRIVATE PATIENT'S ROOM
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: It's always hard to work with terminally ill patients.
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer is at the bedside of the young woman with a stack of paperwork.
</p><p>Carla: Ted's helping Maggie with her will.
</p><p>Maggie: Thanks again, Ted. How'd you get through sixty pages so quickly?
</p><p>Lawyer: Well, Miss Hibersol, it helps to not really know what you're doing.
</p><p>Maggie: Stop it, Ted. You're a great lawyer.
</p><p>Lawyer: [to Carla and Elliot, on his way out] Ohh, I love her.
</p><p>Elliot: Maggie, you seem so at peace with everything.
</p><p>Maggie: There's really only one thing I'll regret.... I'm thirty-eight years old and I'm a virgin.
</p><p>Elliot: Me too.
</p><p>Carla: Elliot!
</p><p>Elliot: Sorry, sorry. It's just a reflex from college when I used to play the tambourine in a Christian rock band. Which was bull because everyone was sleeping with everyone. [Carla swats her] Sorry.
</p><p>Maggie: That's okay. I guess I was just waiting for someone special, and now I feel like I've missed out on one of the fundamental experiences of life for no good reason, you know?
</p><p>Carla: Is there anything we can do?
</p><p>Maggie: Don't people sometimes pay for sex?
</p><p>Elliot: Oh, boy, do they. I slept with Jenny Johnson's older brother in high school, and then he decided to tell all of his friends what my orgasm face looked like. [demonstrates] Then three of them posed like that for their yearbook photos! Paid for that one for years.
</p><p>Carla: Elliot, I think she means pay _money_ for sex.
</p><p>Elliot: Oh, I got a story about that, too -- not about me, though, my mom.... She gets lonely.
</p><p>CAFETERIA
J.D. and Danni are having lunch together. They don't say much to each other.
</p><p>J.D.: Isn't it great being so comfortable with someone, you don't have to talk?
</p><p>Danni: Hmm.
</p><p>J.D.: Anyway, the point is, silence is awesome.
</p><p>Danni: I'm sorry, I'm just a little preoccupied. I accidentally walked in on my sister and Perry this morning. Can you imagine?
</p><p>J.D. walks in to find the two on the bed in bondage leather. He is understandably shocked and disturbed.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Relax, Newbie, the gimp is chained up.
</p><p>Cox rattles a chain attached to a large masked man in the corner.
</p><p>Jordan: Be careful, though, Randall got loose.
</p><p>J.D.: Who?
</p><p>The karate midget appears and punches J.D. in the crotch.
</p><p>J.D.: [collapsing] Owwwwwwwwwwww! ...Why?
</p><p>J.D.: Powerful tiny fists....
</p><p>Danni: I gotta get out of there. You think maybe I could crash at your house?
</p><p>J.D.: Sure. Just bring your own toilet paper. [off her look] It's...kind of a little rule we have with our guests.
</p><p>She gives him an appropriate look and leaves, happy to have somewhere else to stay for such a cheap price.
</p><p>J.D.: Preferably something two-ply!
</p><p>Turk arrives, passing Danni.
</p><p>Turk: How's it going, Danni?
</p><p>Danni: Great. I'm crashing at your place tonight.
</p><p>Turk: Oh, cool.... Bring toilet paper.
</p><p>J.D.: I already told her.
</p><p>Turk takes Danni's vacant seat across from J.D.
</p><p>Turk: How'd you get Dr. Cox to like you?
</p><p>J.D.: [excited] Dr. Cox said he liked me!?
</p><p>Turk: No, you're missing the point--
</p><p>J.D.: I need to know three things immediately: Where was he when he said it, what inflection did he use, and had he been drinking? You know what, I don't care about the third one; sometimes when you've been drinking you're the most truthful.
</p><p>Turk: Okay, look, I know Carla's gonna have her little pre-wedding panic attack, and what if she has her good ol' buddy Dr. Cox there to tell her what a jackass I am, huh? Then what?
</p><p>J.D.: You know what? I'm glad he was drunk.
</p><p>Happy with that, he gets up and leaves the table.
</p><p>Turk: [sarcastic, not like it matters] Thank you.
</p><p>GYM
Dr. Cox is bench-pressing some weights. Turk appears over him.
</p><p>Turk: How was the liquor store, big guy?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: What're you talking about?
</p><p>Turk: Your six-pack. Much love!
</p><p>He taps his own chest and kisses his fingers in respect.
</p><p>With a groan, Cox replaces the barbell on its bar and stands up.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I don't know what you're talking about, there, butch. I don't know if you're sucking up to me or making a pass at me, but I say you skip it and we continue in our state of mutual disdain.
</p><p>Turk: Dr. Cox, you got it all wrong, man! I don't disdain you! It's quite the opposite -- I "dain" you. Yeah. I think if you get to know me better, you just might "dain" me, too.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Here that's interesting. Of course, it's gibberish, but it's--it's interesting nonetheless. I'm gonna go ahead and pass, and here's why: You're a typical surgeon, and as a rule you guys are insensitive and egotistical and you have the sense of humor of about a fourth grader.
</p><p>Turk: That's just not true.
</p><p>Behind Dr. Cox, Todd attracts their attention with a couple of giant rubber workout balls, which he holds in front of his midsection.
</p><p>Todd: Who wants to touch my giant balls?
</p><p>Dr. Cox gives Turk a "See?" look, and Turk is able to hold together a judgmental expression briefly, until Todd squeezes his balls suggestively, causing Turk to crack up.
</p><p>HALL
J.D. is wheeling his patient through -- a tiny person who looks _very_ familiar.
</p><p>J.D.: Well, your kidneys healed up enough to release you, but no sparring in karate class for two months.
</p><p>Randall: Two months!? That's a real punch in the crotch!
</p><p>J.D.: Randall, could you stop using that expression? Because I can't get it out of my head.
</p><p>He wheels past...
NURSES' STATION
Dr. Kelso is talking to Carla and Elliot.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Ladies, explain to me why you are so concerned with my policy on patients having sex in the hospital.
</p><p>Carla: No reason!
</p><p>Elliot: Just curious!
</p><p>Carla: Trying to learn.
</p><p>Elliot: I love you...sir.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Well, why don't we make it the same as my sex policy with my wife: Absolutely not! Now make me a sandwich.
</p><p>He walks off, passing the observation window of...
MR. IVERSON'S ROOM
Dr. Cox is at the bed of his patient.
</p><p>Mr. Iverson: So, you and Jordan had a kid.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Parenthood's pretty amazing.
</p><p>They chuckle over the shared truth.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Tell you what, you're all set. Some peon from surgery's gonna come down here and do your pre-op and then you're good to go.
</p><p>Turk arrives, knocking on the door frame.
</p><p>Turk: Room service. Who ordered the liver?
</p><p>Dr. Cox leaves, passing Turk.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [under breath] Jackass!
</p><p>Turk: [under breath] Bite me. [to Iverson] Great guy!
</p><p>NURSES' STATION
Elliot and Nurse Roberts are there. J.D. stops, handing over a key-ring to Laverne.
</p><p>J.D.: Hey, Laverne, my girlfriend's coming by; would you mind giving her the keys to my apartment?
</p><p>Nurse Roberts: You know, I shacked up with a man before I was married, too. His name was Jesus.
</p><p>Elliot: Our generation has the exact same morals and values as yours.
</p><p>Carla arrives.
</p><p>Carla: Come on, Elliot. Let's go find ourselves a man-whore!
</p><p>Elliot: See ya!
</p><p>They take off, and Dr. Cox arrives.
</p><p>J.D.: You know, but she's not moving in permanently. She's just crashing for a while.
</p><p>Nurse Roberts: Mm-hmm.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: About a year ago, Jordan said she wanted to "crash for a while." Now my office is a nursery, my closet is my office, my clothes are in the entertainment center, and my TV is in the john, which I guess is kind of nice...I don't even know anymore.
</p><p>Ted the Lawyer had been nearby.
</p><p>Lawyer: Same thing happened to me. After my divorce, I told Mariana I was going to crash at her place for a few weeks, and we've been sharing a bed for eight years.
</p><p>J.D.: Isn't Mariana your mother?
</p><p>Lawyer: Hey, who are we talking about here, you or me?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Lookit, here's the rule, there, porn-star: The moment her toothbrush hits your sink, you've got yourself a permanent roomie.
</p><p>A concerned J.D. looks around the apartment at the rolls and rolls of toilet paper -- all fair and square payment for Danni's endless stay. Even Danni herself is clothed in the stuff.
</p><p>J.D.: How long will you be staying?
</p><p>Danni: For a while.
</p><p>She takes a sip of her drink, the container of which is cozied in a roll of TP.
</p><p>Danni: Mmmmm, downy soft.
</p><p>J.D.: There'll be toilet paper everywhere!
...Gotta go.
</p><p>He takes off, leaving Ted and Perry together.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Hey, uh...real sorry about the whole mom situation, there.
</p><p>Lawyer: She has cold toes.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [walking off, disgusted] Aw, Ted, don't be that guy!
</p><p>Lawyer: What guy?
</p><p>No response.
</p><p>Lawyer: What guy?
</p><p>CAB
Carla and Elliot are riding in the back.
</p><p>Elliot: This is so exciting!
The closest I've ever come to breaking the law was in sixth grade, when Alex Peterson sold his mom's Virginia Slims out of his guest house.
</p><p>Carla: Wow! Was he a Blood or a Crip?
</p><p>Elliot: He was Lutheran.
</p><p>Carla: This is it! This is it! Stop the car.
</p><p>The cab screeches to a halt.
</p><p>Carla: Stop the car. Keep the meter running, we'll be right back.
</p><p>They jump out of the car...
...And are soon crawling back into the back seat.
</p><p>Elliot: [squeals] Ha! What a rush! I mean, I have never slept with a prostitute before, but if it is half as much fun as buying one, sign me up!
</p><p>The camera pulls back to reveal that the car they're now in is that of a police car. Busted! The cop in the front seat speaks up:
</p><p>Cop: Hey! Quiet down back there!
</p><p>Elliot: Sorry. Heh.
</p><p>She waves her hand apologetically, revealing the handcuffs binding her and Carla together.
</p><p>MR. IVERSON'S ROOM
Turk is going over a chart with the man as Cox stands by.
</p><p>Turk: Now, even though I won't be performing the transplant, I am a key member of the surgical team. It's too complicated to explain what it is I do, but in layman's terms I...I guess you'd call it "watching."
</p><p>Mr. Iverson: Could you excuse me one second?
</p><p>Turk: Sure.
</p><p>Iverson drops his head back and fakes loud snoring.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [laughs heartily] I taught him that! Well struck, Barry.
</p><p>Turk: Heh. Heh. Let's--let's finish up here, okay?
Have you, uh, been smoking?
</p><p>Mr. Iverson: No, sir.
</p><p>Turk: Drinking?
</p><p>Mr. Iverson: Nope.
</p><p>Turk starts to mark that down, but then Iverson speaks up.
</p><p>Mr. Iverson: Oh. I had a couple of glasses of champagne at my daughter's wedding last month. But a little champagne's no big deal, huh?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Naaahhhh...hahahaha...[off Turk's look]...ah?
</p><p>Cut to...
OUTSITE IVERSON'S ROOM
Turk and Cox exit.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Look. Barry...Barry's a...he's a great guy.
</p><p>Turk: Yeah. I totally forgot the rule to the transplant list is no drinking...unless Cox says you're a great guy.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Come on, pally, guy's been on the transplant list for three stinkin' years -- this is a no-brainer.
</p><p>Turk: You're right. He's out.
</p><p>I.C.U. -- NURSES' STATION
Dr. Cox has taken his problem to Dr. Kelso.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: See, this is why you shouldn't get emotionally invested in your patients.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Hey, Bobbo, now when the dark prince does finally call you home, please promise me that you'll donate your body to science. And I don't mean medical science, I mean NASA. Because when those buzz-cuts have all but given up on trying to figure out just exactly what a black hole is, and they get one look at that space where your heart was supposed to be, well by-gum, you know they're just gonna say, [southern drawl] "Awwww, shucks! That's what it is!"
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Hey, champ! What has two thumbs and doesn't give a crap? [holds up thumbs, pointing in at self] Bob Kelso. How ya doin'.
</p><p>HALL
J.D. takes the long walk toward the Nurses' Station, where Danni is waiting for him.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: All right, you're just gonna have to tell her she can't move in. It's no big deal, it's not like she has the keys yet.
</p><p>Down the hall, she dangles the keys.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</p><p>He continues walking, steeling himself.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: God, I'm horrible at giving bad news! Wait a sec, I'm a doctor, I give bad news all the time. Just like I did with Mr. Clark this morning. Who does his daughter always remind me of?
</p><p>He thinks a moment, then snaps his fingers at the recollection.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Molly Ringwald! Heh. Man, she was good in 'The Breakfast Club'. I should rent that again.
Come on! Focus! You have to tell her!
God, I need something to get me out of it! Anything!
</p><p>Now standing in front of Danni, he's saved by the telephone, which he immediately snaps up.
</p><p>J.D.: [on phone] Hello? ... Yes, this _is_ J.D.! ... I'd _love_ to pick you up at jail!
</p><p>Cut to...
COUNTY JAIL -- EXTERIOR
Carla and Elliot are sitting on a bench, waiting for J.D.
To amuse herself, Elliot calls to a criminal being brought in.
</p><p>Elliot: Slim, what are you in for?
</p><p>Criminal: Robbery.
</p><p>Elliot: Mm. [pointing to herself and Carla] Prostitution! 
</p><p>Carla: Would you please stop enjoying this so much?
</p><p>Elliot: Mm! Photo-op! 
</p><p>She remembers her camera phone and closens up to Carla for a self-pic.
</p><p>Elliot: Slammer! [giggles]
</p><p>Carla: You need to get your arm off me before I throw that phone of yours up in the street.
</p><p>Elliot: Why you gotta be playa-hatin'?
</p><p>They continue to bicker but are interrupted by J.D.
</p><p>J.D.: Konnichiwa. 
So who wants to tell me what happened? Lucy? Ethel?
</p><p>They look away guiltily.
</p><p>GYM
This time Turk is pressing weight, and Dr. Cox soon appears standing over him.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Ohhh, hey Dr. Turk, you old turtle-headed pain in the ass. Aw! Dammit all, Perry, that is _so_ not what you came down here to say! Now you're _better_ than that! Turn the car around!
</p><p>Turk: Oh, so the worm has turned, huh? Don't bother. That's what's wrong with you medical guys. [he punctuates the following by spacing his words out for each press] You ... never ... know ... when ... to ... [rushing from the strain] face reality and realize that things are never gonna change between us!
</p><p>He finally places the barbell back.
</p><p>Turk: Ohh! Hell yeah!
</p><p>BAR
J.D. and Danni sit across from Carla and Elliot in a booth. They watch Elliot consume her food like an animal.
</p><p>Elliot: Mm, it's so nice to have real food again.
</p><p>Carla: Elliot, they didn't even feed us.
</p><p>Danni: I love how much you guys care about your patients.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Wow. Danni is so sweet. What am I worried about?
</p><p>Danni: You know, Jordan and I are from around here, and our friend Chuck's a stripper? I'm sure he knows tons of guys that would love to have sex with your patient.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: What the hell!? What's it gonna be like when she's at my place!?
</p><p>J.D. sits in an easy chair, dressed in his sensible sweater vest and reading glasses, trying to enjoy a good book. Which is damn near impossible with all the nearly naked male strippers dancing around him to The Weather Girls' "It's Raining Men"!
Over in the corner, Danni bumps and grinds with a few of the guys.
</p><p>J.D.: Danni! Can you have the guys practice in the other room, please?
</p><p>Danni: Stop being such a fuddy-duddy! [to the guys] Now, who haven't I slept with yet?
</p><p>J.D.: There'll be banana hammocks everywhere!
</p><p>Carla: Let's roll.
</p><p>Carla and Elliot take off again.
</p><p>OR
Turk and the other members of the surgery team have just finished an operation.
</p><p>Turk: Excellent work, everyone.
</p><p>The Todd approaches one of the masked scrub nurses.
</p><p>Todd: Nurse, I know you're new here, so I wanted to offer you the chance to assist me in a bypass later. And by that I mean we'd bypass the kissing and go straight to the--
</p><p>The nurse removes the mask to reveal some very masculine features.
</p><p>Todd: Oh, my God, you're a dude?
</p><p>Turk intercedes.
</p><p>Turk: Sorry, Larry.
</p><p>Larry goes off to clean up.
</p><p>Todd: Aw, I feel so bad. Look, I'll make it up to him. I will hook him up with...[scans room]...that chick!
</p><p>Turk: Dude, that's Larry again.
</p><p>Todd: Ohhh!
</p><p>Dr. Cox arrives at the observation window and hits the intercom button.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh, hello, and welcome to McSurgeon's. May I take your order? "Yeah, I was thinking about getting a simple operation with no unexpected complications, please?" Oh, gosh, here I'm sorry, we're fresh out of those. But! If you have a child, maybe you'd like to try one of our Infection Meals! That'll be seven thousand dollars, please pay at the second window.
</p><p>Turk comes over to face Cox at the window.
</p><p>Turk: [muffled] You know, I'm really getting sick of this--
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh! I'm sorry! Are you talking? Because I've decided to keep my finger on the button, so I actually can't hear anything that's going on in there. But, for fairness' sake, I've decided to do your end of the conversation. It goes a little something like this: "Blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, cool hip-hop lingo, blah-blah, blah-blah-blah."
Anyway, I've come up with a whole new plan about Mr. Iverson. If you wanna take that liver away from him just because you and I are having some kind of personal beef, then you go and tell the man yourself.
</p><p>With that, he walks away.
Deeper in the room, the rest of the surgery team have been watching in awkward silence.
</p><p>Todd: [to scrub nurse] Don't worry, sweetheart, this'll all be over in a second.
</p><p>Larry: [removing mask] Please stop.
</p><p>Todd: Oh! It's the hips that fool me.
</p><p>HALL
Elliot and Carla approach the door of their patient.
</p><p>Elliot: Hm! Can't believe Chuck gave up stripping to become a city councilman!
</p><p>Carla: Same job, different outfit.
</p><p>Elliot: Pff! True dat!
</p><p>Carla: Elliot! You ain't as ghetto as ya think y'are, 'kay? Let's go see how Maggie's doing.
</p><p>They open the door and gasp at what they see, quickly exiting and shutting the door.
</p><p>Cut to...
I.C.U. -- NURSES' STATION
Dr. Cox is there going over a chart. A young female patient stops by.
</p><p>Patient: Hey.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Can I help you?
</p><p>Patient: No. He told me to say hi.
</p><p>She points, walking away. Turk arrives.
</p><p>Turk: That's Stephanie, our new transplant patient.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh. And you picked her, so I'm quite sure she is so very nice.
</p><p>Turk: No, actually she's alienated every member of my surgical team.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Sweetheart, you're not even _on_ the surgical team.
</p><p>Turk: [defensive] I am a very important part of the team that!-- [calmer] I am a very important part of the team, thankyouverymuch.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I see, so what, that's...that's it? You say she gets the liver and that's the way it goes?
</p><p>Turk: No, she gets the liver because she followed the rules.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Ah-ha.
</p><p>Turk: Dr. Cox, I know it's really hard on you medical guys, because you spend most of your time with your patients and you get emotionally attached. But as a surgeon, the person I'm closest to is the guy who's giving us the liver, because it's a gift, and I think it's important that it goes to the person that's proven they're up to the responsibility.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Holy cow, I get it. I gotta collect myself for a moment, here. That's very touching.
</p><p>He walks off, all "verklempt".
</p><p>Turk: You know I'm right.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Sometimes we forget that rules are there for a reason. Other times, well...
</p><p>Meanwhile...
HALL
Dr. Kelso approaches the door to Maggie's room, but is stopped by Carla and Elliot.
</p><p>Carla: Uh, she's sleeping, sir.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: So?
</p><p>Elliot: You know, there's cupcakes down in Pediatrics!
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Ooh!
</p><p>He goes off in search of cupcakes.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Other times, rules are meant to be broken.
</p><p>Cut to...
MAGGIE'S ROOM
Maggie and Ted the Lawyer lay in her bed in post-coital bliss.
</p><p>Lawyer: You are so beautiful.
</p><p>Maggie: [sighs happily] That was worth the wait! You are a stallion!
</p><p>He blows through his lips like a horse, and she giggles and sighs again.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: And once in a while, you have to throw all the rules out the window and know that everything's gonna be okay.
</p><p>Cut to...
TURK AND J.D.'S APARTMENT
Danni is in the bathroom, finishing brushing her teeth.
</p><p>Danni: I feel really good about this!
</p><p>She drops her toothbrush into the cup on the sink.
</p><p>J.D. calls back to her from his room.
</p><p>J.D.: Me too!
</p><p>Oh, it shows, what with his being curled up in the fetal position on his bed.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: ...Or not.
</p><p>Cut to...
SACRED HEART PARKING LOT
Carla stands waiting, a pack of toilet paper in her arms.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Of course, some rules are just plain silly.
</p><p>Cox exits the building, noticing Carla's possession.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Ya got big plans for tonight?
</p><p>Carla: Oh.... It's Turk's stupid rule, I don't wanna talk about it.
Hey! You never told me what you really think of Turk.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: He is a complete tool.... But I suppose you could do a lot worse.
</p><p>Carla: [smiles] Thanks.
</p><p>Her gives her a friendly smile in return and tosses his keys before going off to his car.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Bye.
