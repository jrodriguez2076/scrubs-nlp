</p>Contents<p>TURK AND J.D.'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
J.D. is struggling to finish getting dressed and grab his stuff. Danni watches him from the couch.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: Relationships can be defined by how long people have been together.<br>
J.D.: I am so late, I don't even have time to eat.<br>
He heads for the door.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: Whether you've been together for a few weeks...<br>
Danni: Do you wanna have sex?<br>
He slams the door shut again and drops his stuff.<br>
J.D.: Yes.<br>
Cut to...
TURK AND J.D.'S CAR -- ON THE ROAD -- LATER
Turk is driving, with Carla next to him and J.D. in the back.
(U2's "Stuck In a Moment You Can't Get Out Of" plays.)<br>
J.D.'s Narration: ...or together for three years.<br>
Carla: Baby?<br>
Turk: Hm?<br>
Carla: What do you think about getting pregnant right after the wedding?<br>
A look of terror attacks Turk's features.<br>
</p><p>Turk: See ya!<br>
And tumbles out into the traffic.<br>
J.D.: Carla! You can't ask a guy that while he's driving!<br>
Carla: My bad.<br>
The car plummets down a cliff...<br>
J.D.: Yes, it was your bad, Carla.<br>
...and crashes.<br>
</p><p>Meanwhile...
DR. COX'S APARTMENT
Jordan is at the computer. Dr. Cox comes in from the bedroom.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: ...Or whether you've been together for more than five years.<br>
Dr. Cox: Why don't we ever have sex?<br>
Jordan: I find it a little hard to feel sexy seeing as I passed a human being out of my body six months ago.<br>
Dr. Cox: Hey, lookit, I had front seats to that bloodbath, and it hasn't affected my sex drive.<br>
Jordan: Oh, no, no, no, no, I got that when you asked the lactation nurse if she needed help getting things started!<br>
Dr. Cox: Right.<br>
Jordan: You know, Perry, a lot of men would be happy just to have a baby.<br>
Meanwhile...
HOSPITAL ENTRANCE
Turk, Carla, J.D., and Elliot come in.<br>
Turk: So, you're currently on the pill, right?<br>
Carla: Yes! Will you please, just drop it!<br>
Turk: Okay. 'Cause, you know, you've gotta take it the same time every day.<br>
She gives him a dirty look.<br>
Turk: Right.<br>
They walk in.<br>
Elliot: When I was in high school, I went to Europe for a month and I forgot to take my birth control pills, so I took like thirty the day I got home.<br>
J.D.: What happened?<br>
</p><p>A teenaged Elliot is all dressed up in a radical outfit, the look compromised by her sparse beard.<br>
Elliot's Mom: [off-screen] Elliot! Your homecoming date is here!<br>
Elliot: Uh.... Stall him!!!<br>
She grabs a razor and slathers her face with shaving cream.<br>
</p><p>Elliot: Nothing.<br>
She rushes off to work.
J.D. stops when he sees the Janitor up ahead, speaking with Todd.<br>
Janitor: [British accent] Oh, Todd, you simply must sample one of these tea buns my mum sent over from Sussex.<br>
Todd takes one of the biscuits from the tin, and holds up his hand for a high-five.<br>
Todd: Up high two times. One's for "buns", one's for the "sex" part of Sussex! Come on!<br>
Janitor: Whoa, an American high-five!<br>
The high-five is given.<br>
Janitor: How perfectly vulgar.<br>
Todd: Yeah.<br>
Doug comes over next to J.D.<br>
J.D.: I think the Janitor's pretending to be British.<br>
Doug: You mean Klaus, the German guy?<br>
The Janitor comes over.<br>
Janitor: [German accent] Guten Tag, Doug.<br>
Doug: Thanks!<br>
He goes off.<br>
Janitor: [German accent, to J.D.] That means "nice haircut."<br>
J.D.: No it doesn't!<br>
Janitor: Mind your own beeswax.<br>
He goes off. J.D. grabs a biscuit from the tin...<br>
J.D.'s Narration: I guess around here, you have to be prepared for anything.<br>
...and tastes it.<br>
J.D.: Mmm, Britishy!<br>
Cut to...
O.R.
Turk and the other surgical staff stand around the table.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: ...Especially if you're dealing with a patient who needs emergency surgery.<br>
Turk: [to the intercom] Uh, where's Dr. Wen? This patient's ready to go.<br>
Staffer: [on intercom] He just called. He got in a car accident, so he can't make it.<br>
Turk: [to intercom] Don't you play with me, intercom lady! I will find you!<br>
Staffer: [on intercom] Relax. Dr. DiStefano is on-call.<br>
Turk: [to self] Thank God.<br>
He turns to the surgical staff.<br>
Turk: We just dodged a bullet because, look, I am nowhere near ready to perform this type of procedure solo. I would have been terrified, you guys would have sensed it, and it would have been a horrible experience for all of us.<br>
Staffer: [on intercom] Dr. DiStefano is stuck in surgery. It's all on you, Dr. Turk.<br>
Turk: Big piece of cake! Who's with me?<br>
They stare at him blankly.<br>
Turk: Come on!!!<br>
</p><p>ADMISSIONS -- FRONT DESK
J.D. watches as Turk and Carla hug and laugh excitedly.<br>
Turk: Oh, yeah!<br>
J.D.'s Narration: The news of Turk's successful surgery had spread quickly. He was the stud of the hospital.<br>
</p><p>Turk: [singing] Who's the black surgeon you know that just repaired an artery like a pro?<br>
Nurses: [sing] Turk!<br>
Turk: That's right, baby.
[singing] Who is the doc that won't cop out when no attendings are about?<br>
Ladies: [sing] Turk!<br>
Turk: Right on.<br>
</p><p>J.D.: [sings] Turk!<br>
Turk: What?<br>
J.D.: Wow. You must be dancing on the wind right now.
...That sounded straighter in my head.<br>
Turk: Dude, today I had to sink or swim all on my own; and guess what? A brother swam.<br>
J.D.: [squeals] That is so fabulous!
What is wrong with me today!?<br>
Dr. Wen walks in.<br>
Turk: Dr. Wen!<br>
Turk runs over to him.<br>
Turk: I was scared when you didn't show up, but...your car accident turned out to be the best thing that's ever happened to me!<br>
Dr. Wen: My wife broke both her legs.<br>
Turk: Heh. Still.<br>
He goes off.<br>
J.D.: Maybe it's just Buddha's way of telling her to slow down a little, you know?<br>
</p><p>PARKING LOT -- BASKETBALL HOOP
Carla watches as Turk lays some smack talk on one of his opponents.<br>
Turk: Oh, are you a big man? What? 
Yeah. Man, I hope you haven't eaten yet, because I'm about to force-feed you a can of my homemade WHUPASS!<br>
Carla: Miguel doesn't speak English, baby.
[translating for Miguel] {Spanish}...WHUPASS!<br>
Turk: Thanks, sweetness!
Hahahaha! Whoa!<br>
He fakes and zips around Miguel, easily sinking the ball.<br>
Dr. Cox, also on he court, recovers the ball and steps up to Turk.<br>
Dr. Cox: Hey, look, Gandhi, now just because you broke out your little Fisher-Price surgery set and somehow managed to _not_ kill somebody for once, doesn't mean you're queen of the world.<br>
Turk: You think you could do better, old man?<br>
Dr. Cox: Watch and learn.<br>
The scene goes to slow motion, with Enrique Iglesias' "Hero" providing the soundtrack to Dr. Cox's awesome dunk.<br>
He hangs on the rim for effect.<br>
Dr. Cox: How's that taste? Is it delicious? Oh?<br>
He jumps down, and there's a popping noise. He freezes.<br>
Dr. Cox's Thoughts: Oh, Lord. My back.<br>
Carla: Are you okay?<br>
Dr. Cox: Come on! I'm simply posing so your boyfriend can get a picture of me for his "People Who Make Me Feel Like a Little Girl" scrapbook. Haaah!<br>
Turk: [to Carla] Let's go.<br>
They head inside.<br>
Dr. Cox: [whimpering] Ohhh, God!<br>
</p><p>HALL
Todd is talking to The Janitor.<br>
Todd: You know, Nigel, I'm twenty-five percent British.<br>
Janitor: [British accent] Really? I'm one hundred percent not interested!<br>
Todd: [laughing] Ohh! Classic Nigel!<br>
He goes off.
J.D. approaches.<br>
J.D.: So, I've been asking around, and apparently you're known as one of three people: Nigel, the Brit; Klaus, the dim-witted German -- yes, I said "dim-witted -- or a simple, good-natured stutterer named Efrem.
Am I the only one that knows the real you?<br>
Janitor: Who says this is the real me? [British accent] Perhaps this is? [German accent] Or this.<br>
Doug arrives.<br>
Doug: Hey, Klaus. In your country, how come Hamburg and Frankfurt, they have nothing to do with hamburgers or hot dogs?<br>
Janitor: [German accent] Why is your Lake Titicaca not filled with boobs and poop?<br>
</p><p>BAR
Elliot is at the bar. The guy next to her starts chatting her up.<br>
Guy: So, what do you do?<br>
Elliot: Oh, I work at a hospital. I'm a resident, which is actually still kind of like a student. Well, not a student as in, like, dorm rooms and pizza runs and crazy, drunken kissing parties -- which I know for a fact still go on in Radiology -- but more of a student in the sense that--<br>
J.D. takes the seat on the other side of Elliot.<br>
J.D.: Excuse me. Dude, she's got a boyfriend.<br>
Guy: Thanks, man.<br>
He goes off.<br>
J.D.: Why didn't you just tell him you were a doctor?<br>
Elliot: I don't know.... I guess I just still don't feel like a doctor, you know? I mean, that whole thing with Turk today really got me thinking. Like, I've ran codes before, but there's always been someone right there ready to bail me out. Like, I've never had that one defining, sink-or-swim moment.
Have you?<br>
J.D.: Yeah, but I didn't, like, make a big deal out of it.<br>
</p><p>J.D. and an old man are having a conversation with an attractive, well-dressed couple.<br>
Man: I was just made partner at my law firm. I drive a Beemer. And this is my wife.<br>
J.D.: Oh, well, this is Mr. Booker. He's alive because of me.<br>
Mr. Booker: I thought you said there'd be some bitches here?<br>
J.D.: We just got here! Look around!<br>
</p><p>J.D.: We actually had a fun night...until he urinated all over my rental car.<br>
</p><p>HALL / NURSES' STATION
Dr. Cox walks along with Doug, his arm around the kid's shoulder.<br>
Dr. Cox: [chuckles] So you're saying your mom made you pancakes this morning, and you didn't even know that it was pancake day in the cafeteria? [chucking] You get outta here!<br>
They arrive at the Station, where Carla is working.<br>
Doug: [giggling] And the craziest thing--<br>
Dr. Cox: No, I'm serious, Nervous Guy: Get outta here!<br>
Doug runs off whimpering.<br>
Carla: Why won't you admit you hurt your back?<br>
Dr. Cox: Carla, come on! Back injuries are for 80-year-old guys named Norman who have pants up to here, nose-hairs down to here, and who start every sentence with the very elegant [snorts and hacks].<br>
Carla: Uh-huh.<br>
She grabs his badge off his coat, and holds it out over the floor.<br>
Carla: Oops. You dropped your badge.<br>
She drops it.
Dr. Cox whimpers slightly.<br>
Carla: Your move there, [hacks] Norman.<br>
Dr. Cox steels himself, and everything goes to slow motion, with "Hero" on the soundtrack again.
Dr. Cox spreads his legs and lowers slowly, slowly, slowly.......
And gets the badge.<br>
Carla: That's impressive.<br>
</p><p>TURK AND J.D.'S APARTMENT -- EVENING
J.D., Danni, and Carla are on the couch, watching TV.<br>
J.D.: You wanna know what the janitor did today?<br>
Danni
&amp;: No!
Carla<br>
Carla: Bambi, you idiot.<br>
Danni: I love 'The Fugitive'. Who would you rather sleep with, Tommy Lee Jones or Harrison Ford?<br>
J.D.: Harrison Ford, hands down.<br>
The girls look at him.<br>
J.D.: ...But you were probably talking to Carla. I'm having such a gay day!<br>
Carla: "Day"?<br>
J.D.: Yeah! It's just this whole janitor thing has thrown me for a loop.<br>
Carla: Danni, we should watch the movie in Turk's room, because he's gonna keep talking about the janitor, even though we begged him not to.<br>
J.D.: I won't, sweetie, trust me.<br>
He gives Danni a reassuring look.<br>
Danni: Let's go.<br>
The two jump up from the couch and head to Turk's room.<br>
J.D.: [calling after them] I just wanna know what kind of freak needs to spend all day pretending to be somebody else!<br>
Movie Cop: Uh, listen, this is ____unit number 23. I got a possible sighting of Richard Kimball on northbound ______.<br>
J.D. looks closer at the cop on the screen. He looks oddly familiar.<br>
Movie Cop: Kimball!<br>
J.D.: Janitor!<br>
</p><p>I.C.U. -- PATIENT'S ROOM
Elliot is with her patient, a slightly older man.<br>
Elliot: Mr. Moran, I don't want to make any promises, but, uh, your cellulitis is resolving nicely, and I think that you'll be out of the woods soon.<br>
Mr. Moran: So tell me something: How did an old geezer like me end up with the prettiest young doctor in the place?<br>
Elliot: It's actually just a simple rotation system based on when your shift started and the last patient that you've seen--<br>
Mr. Moran: Sweetheart, I'm just paying you a compliment.<br>
Elliot looks pleasantly surprised. Before she can say anything, her beeper goes off. She looks at the display.<br>
Elliot: I have to go.<br>
She rushes from the room, stopping for a brief second to stick her head back in.<br>
Elliot: Thanks for saying I'm pretty.<br>
Meanwhile...
DR. COX'S APARTMENT
Dr. Cox stumbles in, dropping his stuff and lurching towards the couch.<br>
Dr. Cox: Mm. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello...sweet...oh, sweet couch.<br>
As soon as he collapses there, the lights dim and swanky music comes on the stereo. Jordan stands in the doorway to the bedroom in some sexy lingerie.<br>
Jordan: I've been thinking about what you said this morning. And you're right, we have not been having enough sex lately.<br>
Dr. Cox: Turns out yes, yes we have.<br>
Jordan: No, we haven't. And tonight, we're gonna do it the way you always fantasized about.<br>
Dr. Cox: Laying down in a big tub of ice?<br>
Jordan: Standing up, against the wall, you holding me up. What do you say, Romeo?<br>
J.D.'s Narration: Sometimes the moment you've been waiting for comes at the most inopportune time.<br>
Dr. Cox: Let's do this!<br>
Jordan: Mmmmm.<br>
He stands up and picks her up. We hear his back pop.<br>
Dr. Cox: Arggghhh! Oh, yeah! Ohhhh, yeah!<br>
Meanwhile...
HOSPITAL -- I.C.U.
Elliot rushes through.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: Sometimes the moment comes when you feel like you've been waiting for it your whole life. You just have to hope that no one beats you in there and steals your thunder.<br>
J.D. comes out of another room and joins Elliot in the race to the coding patient's room.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: 'Cause if they do, well...you're just gonna end up standing in the corner, watching.<br>
They burst into the room, where staff are gathered working on the patient.<br>
Carla: He's in complete heart block.<br>
J.D. pushes over to the bed, and jumps to action. Elliot stands in the doorway, waiting for an opportunity to help.<br>
J.D.: Get those transcutaneous pads; push one milligram Atropine. Where's the cart?<br>
Outside he door, a few staffers approach with the cart of medical equipment.<br>
J.D.: Elliot!<br>
Elliot: Yeah?<br>
J.D.: Get outta the way! They're trying to get through!<br>
She jumps back, and the cart is brought in. She stands by watching as J.D. and the others go to work.<br>
J.D.: Okay, start a line. Hyperventilate, here we go.
Not going anywhere.<br>
</p><p>ADMISSIONS
Elliot watches as J.D. speaks to the patient's family (FYI, they're black).<br>
Family Member: Dr. Dorian, you can't imagine how grateful we are.<br>
J.D.: Let me ask you something: Who's the cool doc you call when you want to save your husband, Paul? J.D.!<br>
They stare at him blankly.<br>
J.D.: It's from 'Shaft'? Come on, how could you guys not get that?<br>
Family Member: Yeah.... That's our 'Citizen Kane'.... Anyway, thanks again. You're a real hero.<br>
J.D.: Oh, please, I put my pants on one leg at a time, just like you guys. <br>
They smile and leave.<br>
J.D.: ...Except, after I put my pants on, I save your husband's life! Oh, no he didn't!<br>
Finally, he turns and sees Elliot.<br>
J.D.: Ohh, Smelliot! What's the happie-haps!<br>
She gives him a dirty look and heads down the hall.<br>
</p><p>DR. COX'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM
Jordan lies sleeping, Perry, in agony, is wide awake. She stirs.<br>
Jordan: Whoa. I was in a sex coma. How'd you sleep?<br>
Dr. Cox: [pained] Great!<br>
Jordan: Ohh, and Perry? I know I asked you to be more sensitive when we do it, but I was just hoping you wouldn't curse as much. I mean, to actually cry during sex, what's that about?<br>
Dr. Cox: I guess I just love you so...much...?<br>
Meanwhile...
NURSES' STATION
J.D. catches up with Elliot.<br>
J.D.: What is wrong with you? Is this because I called you "Smelliot"? Because I can't believe you haven't heard that before.<br>
Elliot: [curt] J.D., I don't care if you call me that.<br>
J.D.: Hey, everybody! She's cool with "Smelliot"!<br>
Todd: Oh, so he can call you "Smelliot" but I'm not allowed to call you "Vagina Face"?<br>
Elliot: Not the same, Todd!<br>
Todd: HMPH!<br>
He turns on his heel in a huff.<br>
Elliot: Look, J.D., that was my patient; I was one step behind you, and you knew it. You stole my moment.<br>
J.D.: This isn't about moments, it's about saving lives. Elliot, when I put my pants on--<br>
Elliot: Yeah, I don't want to hear anything more about your pants!
Look, we both know what this is about -- from the second I started dating Sean, you obviously weren't happy. I thought that would change when you met someone, but I guess I've moved on and you're just acting like you have.<br>
J.D.: Uhh, okay. Prepare for a storm-off. Hmph!<br>
He turns and storms off.<br>
</p><p>HALL
Turk and Carla are walking through.<br>
Carla: Turk, the night we got engaged, you said you couldn't wait to have kids.<br>
Turk: How can you hold that against me? You were naked!<br>
Carla: So I should just disregard everything you say when I'm naked?<br>
Turk: You know, that's not actually a bad idea? We can call it The Naked Rule; and it should probably apply retroactively, so, um, you can get yourself to the airport next weekend?<br>
Carla: [rolling eyes] Fine.<br>
She heads off.<br>
Turk: Gotta love The Naked Rule!<br>
Continue to...
DOCTORS' LOUNGE
Carla enters, nearly treading on Dr. Cox, who's flat on his back on the floor.<br>
Dr. Cox: Say, Carla...boy, you...you look nice.<br>
Carla: You're pathetic.<br>
Dr. Cox: How's about we skip the insults and you do something helpful like prop me up, or throw on a skirt.<br>
</p><p>HALL
J.D. confronts the Janitor, who's mopping.<br>
J.D.: You're an actor.<br>
Janitor: You're a fireman! What are we doing?<br>
J.D.: Game over, Klaus. I saw you in 'The Fugitive'.<br>
Janitor: Ohhh, yeah, yeah. I was in a Harrison Ford movie, but, you know what, I chose this life instead 'cause it's a little more glamorous.<br>
Dr. Kelso stops on his way through.<br>
Dr. Kelso: [to Janitor] Hey, champ. There's some vomit on the back steps with your name on it.<br>
Janitor: Well, that's my cue. Action!<br>
He leaps on his broom and gallops off down the hall, to the tune of 'The Lone Ranger'.<br>
J.D.: Cut!<br>
</p><p>I.C.U. -- PATIENT'S ROOM
Elliot is with her patient.<br>
Mr. Moran: Young lady, would it brighten your day any if I told you I thought you were the best damn doctor in this hospital?<br>
Elliot: Mr. Moran, why couldn't my father be more like you? I mean, if I had a dollar for every time I got depressed and my dad didn't make me feel better-- Actually, he _did_ give me a dollar every time I got depressed. By the end of junior high, I already had a hundred and seventy bucks.... And then got mugged and lost it all. But, by the end of that night, of course, I was back up to a dollar.<br>
Mr. Moran: Sweetheart, why don't you tell me what's really upsetting you.<br>
She turns and looks out the observation window just as J.D. and Turk are walking past.<br>
Elliot: [pointing dramatically] Him.<br>
Follow to...
HALL
Turk and J.D. are talking.<br>
J.D.: Can you believe her? She says I beat her to that code because I still have feelings for her. I don't even think about her that way anymore.<br>
Turk: Dude, you can't _not_ think about her that way.<br>
J.D.: Whatevah!<br>
Turk: Okay, think about her right now.<br>
J.D. thinks.<br>
</p><p>J.D. and Elliot are on the couch. They kiss.
</p><p>Turk: Now think about her and Sean together.<br>
J.D. thinks.<br>
</p><p>J.D. and Elliot are on the couch. They kiss.
</p><p>Turk: Now think about her and me together.<br>
J.D. thinks.<br>
</p><p>Elliot and a black guy are on the couch. They kiss. She pulls back, and it's just a darker, bald J.D.<br>
J.D.: That's what's up.<br>
</p><p>Turk: Kissing her all three times, except the third time you were a black guy?<br>
J.D.: Yeah....<br>
</p><p>DOCTORS' LOUNGE
Carla is helping Dr. Cox sit up and lean against the wall.<br>
Carla: Let me do it. Let me do it.
Okay. You are entering a new phase in your life; why are you fighting it?<br>
Dr. Cox: I'm not--I'm not fighting anything.<br>
Carla: So, even though you have a full head of hair, you still take Propecia because you like the way it tastes?<br>
Dr. Cox: You know, the other day I found a gray hair in my happy trail.<br>
Carla: Is that the patch of hair that goes from your belly button down to your pe--<br>
Dr. Cox: It is, indeed.<br>
Carla: So? You have a gray happy trail! A lot of women find it distinguished.<br>
Dr. Cox: Carla, I have a six-month-old child. I'm gonna be one of those weird old guys who brings my son down to the park, where everybody is like, Hmm, is he the dad? Is he the grand-dad? Is he the grand-dad's grand-dad? And, oh, my God! Why is he pushing a traffic cone on the swing while his five-year-old little boy is in the mud crying? Is--is he taunting the little boy? No! He can't even see the little boy! And, now look, he's actually taking the traffic cone, putting it in the mini-van, and driving away while the little boy cries and the traffic cone sits quietly and watches 'Finding Nemo' on DVD.<br>
They laugh together at the tragic story.<br>
Carla: Look, for what it's worth, instead of marrying a long time ago, I'm marrying a guy who probably won't be ready to have kids for another ten years! That'll make me like thirty...grghrghrgh.<br>
Dr. Cox: More like forty-rghrghrghrgh.<br>
Carla: But you know what? It's okay. Because I couldn't handle marriage until now. And I knew you when you were younger, and you would have been a horrible dad. Now? We're both ready.<br>
Dr. Cox: Do you...do you think that my son will like me?<br>
Carla: Oh, God, no.<br>
Dr. Cox: Oh.<br>
</p><p>I.C.U. -- NURSES' STATION
Dr. Kelso approaches Elliot.<br>
Dr. Kelso: Dr. Reid, I need to get Enid a birthday present.<br>
Elliot: Ahh! When's her birthday?<br>
Dr. Kelso: I think it was last week.<br>
Elliot: Um...well, a scarf is always nice.<br>
Dr. Kelso: That's perfect. It's simple; it's elegant; and it'll hide her turkey neck.<br>
Elliot doesn't have a chance to comment, as her beeper goes off. She looks at it.<br>
Elliot: Mr. Moran is coding.<br>
She rushes off.<br>
Dr. Kelso: Dr. Reid---<br>
Elliot races through to her patient's room. As she approaches, J.D. joins her in the race.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: At the end of the day, medicine's pretty competitive; so I guess you have to do whatever's right for you.<br>
They stop at the door.<br>
J.D.: Go.<br>
He stands back and watches through the window as Elliot and the staff work on the patient.<br>
Elliot: Okay, let's start a central line; we just have to get the crash cart. Have we established an airway?<br>
Nurse Roberts: It's obstructed.<br>
Elliot: We're gonna need to do an emergency trach. Get the scalpel and the trach. kit. Go on.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: Watching Elliot in there, I couldn't help but be impressed.<br>
Elliot: Hurry! Faster!<br>
J.D.: She was amazing.<br>
Elliot: Let's go, you guys! Come on!<br>
J.D.'s Narration: Unfortunately, in medicine, even if you do everything perfectly...<br>
Despite all their work, the patient flat-lines.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: ...there are still no guarantees.<br>
Elliot emerges from the room.<br>
J.D.: Sorry.<br>
She gives him a heavy look and continues down the hall.<br>
Tammany Hall's "Someone" begins.<br>
</p><p>HALL
J.D. passes the Janitor.<br>
Janitor: [Cockney accent] Evenin' governor!<br>
J.D. doesn't respond.<br>
Janitor: [Cockney] Hey, what's up your bum?<br>
J.D.: You know why I wanted that to be you in 'The Fugitive'? Because it would mean you used to be a guy who had dreams and ambitions; and even though things didn't work out the way you'd hoped, at least it would explain why you are the way you are and...make you human. But instead, it turns out you're nothing more than a...a jerk who just likes to mess with people for no reason.<br>
He starts to continue down the hall, but the Janitor assumes the pose of the movie cop.<br>
Janitor: "Kimball!"<br>
J.D. raises his eyebrows.<br>
Janitor: You tell anybody, I'll kill ya.<br>
Just then, another doctor comes up to the Janitor, patting him on the shoulder.<br>
Doctor: Goodnight, Efrem!<br>
Janitor: Goo-goo-goo-goodnight...doctor.<br>
J.D.'s Narration: Some people hide from who they really are.<br>
Meanwhile...
HALL
Turk and Todd stop Carla, who is pushing a sheet-covered body on a gurney.<br>
Turk: Hey, baby. Todd and I are going to the arcade, so I'ma get some quarters out your purse.<br>
