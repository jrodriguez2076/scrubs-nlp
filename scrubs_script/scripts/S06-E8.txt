</p>Contents<p>SACRED HEART -- ADMISSIONS
A larger woman is at the desk, with Jack standing in front of her.
</p><p>Jack: [Pointing and singing] You're a fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty fatty!
</p><p>Dr. Cox comes over.
</p><p>Woman: What's your son doing?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Apparently he's doing the "fatty dance." [Picks Jack up.] Inappropriate? Well, maybe. But I'm raising my son to be a straight-shooter. That's his mom, right over there.
</p><p>He points over to Jordan leaning in the doorway.
</p><p>Jordan: Ohh, thanks for including me.
</p><p>The woman shakes her head.
Cox grins proudly at his kid and carries him off.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Dr. Cox and Jordan weren't the only ones with kid troubles. My brand new girlfriend was pregnant, and we were trying to decide what to do.
</p><p>Cut to...
KIM'S APARTMENT
J.D. and Kim sit side by side on the couch.
</p><p>J.D.: Should we keep it or get rid of it?
</p><p>Kim: I dunno. If we keep it, it'll just end up in the dumpster. 
[Reveal the last piece of pizza in the box in front of them.] 
Okay! Enough pizza talk -- I mean, we're clearly stalling, here.
</p><p>J.D.: You're right.
</p><p>Kim: So, uh, let's go.... Um.... Do you like kids?
</p><p>J.D.: Of course I do! What about you? Any nieces or nephews?
</p><p>Kim: Yeah, I have a nephew. Although he's forty-five. But occasionally I do have to change his diaper -- he was kicked by a horse.
</p><p>J.D.: Oh, no!
</p><p>Kim: Yeah. 
Now, how do you feel about adoption?
</p><p><br>
BAR -- TWENTY-SOME YEARS IN THE FUTURE
A salt-&amp;-pepper-haired, mustachioed J.D. leans in to look at the necklace on the hot blonde before him.
</p><p>Old J.D.: So beautiful! I hope you keep some ice in this locket, 'cause you're making me hot all over!
</p><p>Girl: Actually, it's the only picture I have of my biological father. D'you wanna see it?
</p><p>She opens it up and we see a picture of young J.D. doing a stupid finger point.
Older J.D. didn't catch a glimpse, because he was looking off towards someone else in the bar, doing his stupid finger point.
</p><p>Old J.D.: What? Oh! Sure! Uh, I'll take a look at it -- first thing tomorrow morning, huh?
</p><p>J.D.: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of adoption.
</p><p>Kim: You think if it's a girl, you'd doink her?
</p><p>J.D.: I know I will.
</p><p>Kim: Yep. All right, well, look, we don't need to make this decision tonight, right? I mean, plenty of time.
</p><p>J.D.: I'm totally fine with stalling.
</p><p>His phone rings, and he answers it.
</p><p>Kim: Great! 'Cause if I hear the word "baby" one more time, I'm gonna lose it!
</p><p>Meanwhile...
SACRED HEART -- HALL
Turk's on the other end of the phone.
</p><p>Turk: Dude! Carla's in labor! Meet me at the apartment! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
</p><p>He runs off down the hall.
</p><p>Cut to...
TURK &amp; CARLA'S APARTMENT
Elliot is on the couch with Carla, monitoring her progress, as Turk comes out of the bedroom in his casual clothes.
</p><p>Turk: [Panicked] Is he coming? Is he coming!?
</p><p>Elliot: Turk, she's barely in labor.
</p><p>Carla: Oh, he's not talking about the baby.
</p><p>The front door bursts open, and J.D. and Kim enter.
</p><p>Turk: He's here! And now we can have our baby!
</p><p>J.D.: Okay, Brown Bear, commence Operation Brown Cub! Suitcase!
</p><p>Turk: [Holding up a bag] Check.
</p><p>J.D.: Stylish big daddy hat!
</p><p>Turk: [Donning a feathered fedora] Check.
</p><p>J.D.: Big-time collegiate drum-line!
</p><p>Cut to...
STREET
Turk stands in front of the percussionists of a marching band.
</p><p>Turk: Check!
</p><p>The band starts up.
</p><p>Turk: I want the whole world to know my baby's having a baby!
</p><p>Turk and J.D. dance to the beat.
</p><p>Carla: [To Elliot, over the noise] Maybe we should just take your car!
</p><p>The band pauses and resumes with a beat that leads in to...
</p><p>SACRED HEART -- MATERNITY CENTER WAITING ROOM
Turk and J.D. rush in the front door, carrying a small paper bag.
</p><p>J.D.: 'Kay, ladies, we're here; calm down.
</p><p>They meet up with Carla, Elliot, and Kim at the desk.
</p><p>Carla: What the hell took you so long? [Noticing the bag] Oh, my God, did you stop for food?
</p><p>Kim: [Gasps.]
</p><p>Turk: We had to, honey. J.D. promised the band that we'd feed them.
</p><p><br>
FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU -- EARLIER
The whole band is lined up behind the mini, a couple drummers standing in the back seat (one lightly drumming), as J.D. orders from the squawk-box.
</p><p>J.D.: Yeah, let me get twenty-three cheeseburgers, twenty-three milkshakes-- [turns to the drummer] Miguel, if you don't stop drumming, you're not getting fries. 
[Miguel stops.] 
[Back to the box] Twenty-three fri-- [Miguel starts again.] You know what, twenty-two fries. Twenty-two fries -- you didn't think I'd do it, did you.
</p><p>J.D.: Miguel has such raw talent, but his attitude keeps getting in the way.
</p><p>The girls stare at him, incredulous.
</p><p>Elliot: Unbelievable.
</p><p>The Sullivan-Cox family comes in, Perry with a bouquet of flowers in hand.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Yay, congratulations, whoopee, all right, see ya.
</p><p>He shoves the bouquet at Carla and starts to walk back out.
</p><p>Jordan: [Stopping him] Eh eh eh eh eh. Heh heh.
</p><p>He groans and takes Jack over to the chairs.
</p><p>Jordan: We are so happy for you!
</p><p>From nowhere, a spray of dirt hits Kim in the face, with some getting Elliot and Carla as well.
Jack is revealed to have uprooted a potted plant, spinning in circles with the stalk.
</p><p>Jack: [Unprofessional mumbling.] 
Subtitle: I'm a helicopter, I'm a helicopter, I'm a helicopter.
</p><p>Kim: He's so sweet!
</p><p>Jordan: Mm.
</p><p>Kim: [Pulling J.D. aside] You put one of those inside me! What are we gonna do?
</p><p>She goes off to clean up.
</p><p>Carla: Turk, you brought my suitcase, right?
</p><p>He stops and thinks.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
TURK &amp; CARLA'S APARTMENT BUILDING
The bag sits on the sidewalk.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
MATERNITY CENTER
</p><p>Turk: Of course I have your suitcase, honey.
</p><p>He turns from her and walks a few paces away, stopping in the middle of the waiting room and closing his eyes.
</p><p>J.D.: What are you doing?
</p><p>Turk: Sometimes when you need a miracle, you have to pray extra-extra hard. You wanna help me out?
</p><p>J.D.: Fo' shizzle.
</p><p>They hold hands and squeeze their eyes shut.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
TURK &amp; CARLA'S APARTMENT BUILDING
A golden retriever happens upon the abandoned bag and picks it up in his mouth.
</p><p>We follow him through the woods...
</p><p>To the front doors of the hospital, where he carries the bag in.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
MATERNITY CENTER WAITING ROOM
Turk and J.D. keep praying.
</p><p>Turk: Please, Lord.
</p><p>The dog comes in and drops the bag at their feet, then scampers off.
</p><p>Just then, an unsavory fellow happens by and notices the guys' closed eyes. He takes the opportunity to steal the bag at their feet and run off.
</p><p>The guys finally open their eyes and look around, disappointed.
</p><p>Turk: Nothing! [Sighs, steeling himself] Okay. 
[Turns back to the desk] Baby! Changed my mind. Don't have your suitcase.
</p><p>Carla: Turk! What the hell?
</p><p>Elliot: It's okay. It's okay, Carla, because I [lifts a different bag] packed you an extra overnight bag, and you're all checked in, and I got you an orderly to take you to your room.
</p><p>The orderly wheels the chair over to Jordan.
</p><p>Jordan: Yeah, I'm only four months pregnant, ace.
</p><p>Carla: Oh, yeah, I think you're looking for me.
</p><p>Jordan: [To the orderly] Move it along before I eat you! Chop chop.
</p><p>MATERNITY CENTER HALL
Dr. Cox bangs on the unresponsive ice machine.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Ah. Sorry, Jack, the machine's broken. Looks like you're gonna have to guzzle your juice down without any ice. Pretend, um.... You know, pretend it's gin.
</p><p>Jack: [Behind him] What's gin?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [Bending down to him] Gin is an alcoholic beverage which, if your mommy's strong genes are any indication, you'll eventually learn to love as it slowly destroys a giant portion of your adult life.
</p><p>Jack walks back towards the waiting room as Cox, snickering, stands back up to Jordan.
</p><p>Jordan: First the fat lady, now this? He's three, Perry! Do you have to be so blunt with him?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I'm not gonna B.S. my own kid. What's the big deal?
</p><p>Dr. Kelso stops on his way through and bends down to Jack.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Hiya, sport!
</p><p>Jack: Your skin is wrinkly.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Yeah? Well that shirt you're wearing is gay!
</p><p>He stands and walks off, grinning devilishly.
</p><p>BIRTHING ROOM
Elliot is at Carla's bedside as Turk rushes in with a camera on a tripod, which he sets up at the foot of the bed.
</p><p>Turk: Hey, baby. I know things haven't exactly gone smoothly so far, but I promise you I'm about to make it up to you. I spent all weekend talking to my cousin who just so happens to be the world's biggest blerd. 
[They give him a questioning look.] 
It's a black nerd.
</p><p>Elliot: Ohhh.
</p><p>Turk: Anyway, he taught me everything about streaming video; and now, thanks to me, your sisters in Chicago will be able to witness the birth of our child live via webcam!
</p><p>Carla: Turk! That's so sweet!
</p><p>Turk: You know, I do what I do. 
All we gotta do is wait for the cameraman to get here.
</p><p>Carla: Camera man? Nuh-uh! No man's gonna me filming my pooter unless he's completely asexual!
</p><p>Ted: [Entering] Hello!
</p><p>Carla: Oh! Hey, Ted! Cool.
</p><p>Turk: All right. I'ma go tell your sisters that this bad boy is about to pop off.
</p><p>He leaves, passing Carla's gynecologist on his way in.
</p><p>Dr. Matthews: All right, Carla. Let's check how dilated you are.
</p><p>Ted: [Positioning the camera] Looking real good, Carla. Okay, we're live in three, two, one....
</p><p>Meanwhile...
DOCTORS' LOUNGE
Todd looks up at the TV which is suddenly broadcasting Dr. Matthews lifting Carla's sheet.
</p><p>Dr. Matthews: [On TV] Okay. Looks like you're at about three centimeters.
</p><p>Todd: Greatest show ever!
</p><p>Meanwhile...
DR. KELSO'S OFFICE
He glances up at his TV.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: [Grabbing the remote] And...record.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
ADMISSIONS
Janitor stops his mopping when he notices the TV.
</p><p>Janitor: Cool! Swamp thing!
</p><p>Meanwhile...
MATERNITY CENTER WAITING ROOM
Jack stares at the TV as Cox and Jordan sit reading.
</p><p>Jack: What's that, daddy?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [Looking up] Oh, that's the vagina of a 35-year-old Latina woman.
</p><p>Turk comes in and notices the TV.
</p><p>Turk: Baby?
</p><p>Meanwhile...
BIRTHING ROOM
In the midst of her deep breathing, Carla catches a glimpse of her TV and stops. She shimmies to the left...then the right...then all around.
</p><p>Carla: What the!?!?
</p><p>Suddenly, Turk bursts in, tackling Ted and the camera to the floor.
</p><p>NURSES' STATION
J.D. and Kim are at the desk.
</p><p>Kim: J.D., we have to talk about all of our pregnancy options, even if they make us uncomfortable. There's one way of dealing with this that no one's mention yet.... The A-word.
</p><p>J.D.: I know....
</p><p>J.D.: Appletinis 
&amp; 
Kim: Abortions.
</p><p>Kim: What?
</p><p>J.D.: I thought that we could discuss abortion over appletinis.
</p><p>Nurse Roberts: [Scooting her chair over] Did somebody just say "abortion"?
</p><p>J.D. points accusingly at Kim.
</p><p>Kim: [Sighs.] Laverne, with all due respect, this is none of your business. Or Jesus's.
</p><p>Nurse Roberts: [Plunking a Jesus statue on the desk] I believe He would beg to differ.
</p><p><br>
The statue comes to life.
</p><p>Jesus: She's right, J.D. Every life is precious.
</p><p>J.D.: But what if having this baby is a huge mistake for us?
</p><p>Jesus: [Sighs and rubs his eyes] Okay, I'm gonna make this real simple: No abortions, okay?
</p><p>J.D.: But what if--
</p><p>Jesus: [Sing-songy] No abortions!
</p><p>J.D.: Lemme finish! What if the parents were like abusive drug addicts who would neglect their kids?
</p><p>Jesus: Oh, well, in that case it'd be okay.
</p><p>J.D.: Really?
</p><p>Jesus: NO ABORTIONS! How are you not getting this!?
</p><p>Kim: This sucks. I mean, the hardest decision I've had to make in the last year was what hairstyle to get. And even then, all I did was open up an US Magazine, close my eyes and pick a random celebrity.
</p><p>J.D.: Kirsten Dunst?
</p><p>Kim: Owen Wilson.
</p><p>J.D.: Ohhh!
</p><p>Kim: Yeah.
</p><p>They turn and walk down the hall together.
</p><p>Kim: You know what's making this so hard? This relationship is so new, we can't tell if we have a chance of making this work long-term.
</p><p>J.D.: You know what might give us an inkling? We haven't technically had sex yet. That might help us find out if we're on the same page...you know...in the boudoir.
</p><p>Kim: Are you hitting on me?
</p><p>J.D.: I'm sorry, I'm being an idiot, aren't I.
</p><p>Kim: Nope. Clothes off. We're doing it.
</p><p>She kicks open the On-Call Room door behind her and pulls him in.
</p><p>J.D.: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...!
</p><p>The door slams shut.
A few seconds later, it opens again.
</p><p>J.D.: ...Yeah! 
[They come back out, tidying their unkempt selves.] 
All right, we are definitely sexually compatible. I'm putting that down in the pro-"let's have a baby" category.
</p><p>Kim: That's--that's exactly what we should do -- we should make a list of pros and cons.
</p><p><br>
Jesus stands on the nearby handrail.
</p><p>Jesus: What did you two just do? Because I sure don't see any wedding rings!
</p><p>J.D. grabs and holds up the statue.
</p><p>J.D.: Laverne? Is this your Jesus?
</p><p>BIRTHING ROOM
Elliot is rubbing Carla's back as she stares daggers at Turk. Todd enters.
</p><p>Todd: Turk, I got your shift covered so you could hang here. Oh, and Carla, there's something I wanted to tell you.... Oh: Great vagina!
</p><p>Turk: [Mad] So helpful!
</p><p>Carla: Don't take it out on The Todd! He was just giving me a compliment! Thank you, Todd.
</p><p>Todd: Hey, happy to say it.
</p><p>He leaves.
</p><p>Carla: So what's next, Turk? Because so far, I'm half deaf from a drum-line, I have no suitcase, and the entire hospital has seen Miss Priscilla! 
[Elliot gives her a look.] 
I named her after my high school art teacher.
</p><p>Elliot: Oh, my God! So did I! [Sighs, nostalgic] Mr. Hebbler. 
[Gravel-voiced in imitation, to Carla's crotch] "It's nice to meet you!"
</p><p>Carla: Ew.
</p><p>DOCTORS' LOUNGE
J.D. and Kim sit side by side on the couch, with notepads in their laps.
</p><p>Kim: Okay, let me just read the last of the cons: We're not married, we're both totally focused on our careers, babies are known to be sticky, and the average cost of raising a child is four-hundred-thousand dollars.
</p><p>J.D.: Okay. Here are the final pros: Kids are great --
</p><p>Kim: Yes.
</p><p>J.D.: -- we both make good money --
</p><p>Kim: Yes.
</p><p>J.D.: -- your boobs'll get huge --
</p><p>Kim: True.
</p><p>J.D.: -- I can finally buy Beanie Babies without feeling weird, and kids are great!
</p><p>Kim: Which we already said.
</p><p>J.D.: [Adding] Tax deductions!
</p><p>Kim: Ohhh! Nice one! 
&amp; 
J.D.: Ohhh! Yeah! That's some--
</p><p>Kim: All right, so then what's the final tally?
</p><p>J.D.: Nice. Let's see, that's twenty cons and nineteen pros. I guess we gotta abort.
</p><p>Kim: Yep.
</p><p>J.D.: Wait, I'm sorry. [Flicking his pad] That's an eyelash, I made a wish. It's a tie -- abortion's off.
</p><p>Kim: Okay, so now what?
</p><p>Matt Nathanson's "I Saw" starts.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Every couple has its share of problems.
</p><p>Meanwhile...
HALL
The Sullivan-Cox family walks through.
</p><p>Jordan: Congrats, Perry. My son just asked me if my vagina had ever been on television.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: And did you tell him not since the late 'eighties when you were trying to make it as [air quotes] "an actress"?
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: Whether it's someone digging in...
</p><p>Jordan: Will you just cut the crap and stop treating your son like he's your drinking buddy?
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Look, I'm not going to change who I am, all right? End o' story. 
[Turns to his lagging kid] Jacky. [Whistles.]
</p><p>Meanwhile...
BIRTHING ROOM
Elliot finishes lighting a bunch of candles spread around Carla's room.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: ...or someone stealing your thunder.
</p><p>Elliot: Okay, candles are all lit -- lavender scented, your favorite. And here's a picture of your mom to watch over you [places it on the table]. And then I've got this kit [lifts a big box] in case you want to bronze the umbilical cord and use it for a keychain. [Holds up a keychain] I practiced at home on some calamari.
</p><p>Carla: [Admiring the keychain] Elliot, you're amazing.
</p><p>Turk: We--hey, is there anything I can do to help?
</p><p>Carla: Elliot's got everything covered.
</p><p>Elliot smiles proudly.
At a loss, Turk leaves the room.
</p>
