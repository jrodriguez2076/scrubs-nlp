</p>Contents<p>DR. COX &amp; JORDAN'S APARTMENT -- EVENING
Cox grabs the paper on his way in the front door, immediately flopping into a chair at the dining table.
Jordan grabs the paper from his face, alerting him to the presence of Jack at the table.
</p><p>Jordan: [Handing him a fork] Welcome home, Perry. Here's the new program: You occasionally lift a finger helping with Jack, and I'm gonna try to keep from hating the unborn baby in my belly that's made my ass so big, I can't fit the whole thing on a toilet when I pee eight hundred times a day! I can't.
</p><p>She goes into the living room as Cox shovels a bit of food onto the fork and holds it out to Jack.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: You love spaghetti. You had some just last night, didn't ya?
</p><p>Jack: No, I didn't!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Jordan, the boy is lying to me.
</p><p>Jordan: Oh, Perry, nobody likes a tattle-tail!
</p><p>Jack: Nobody does, Perry!
</p><p>A handful of spaghetti is pelted into Perry's face.
</p><p>Cut to...
JACK'S BEDROOM -- LATER
Dr. Cox tucks Jack into bed.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: All right, champ. Just in case you get hungry later on....
</p><p>A large handful of spaghetti is dropped on Jack's face.
Cox laughs gleefully.
</p><p>SACRED HEART -- ADMISSIONS
Turk and Elliot are at the front desk.
</p><p>Turk: [Messing with his cell phone] Yo, Elliot...what's your ringtone?
</p><p>Elliot: "Jesus, Take the Wheel" by Carrie Underwood.
</p><p>Todd: [Stopping] I'm carrying underwood right now. See, that's funny because it's true. [Holds up his hand for a five, but Elliot looks disgusted.] Please?
</p><p>Elliot: [Gives him the five.] But that's all you get for the rest of the year, Todd.
</p><p>He nods reluctantly and leaves.
</p><p>Turk: I'm downloading 'N Sync's "Bye Bye Bye." When that bad boy starts a-jumpin', I defy anyone not to shake their butt to it. I'm bringing it back.
</p><p>Elliot: Just like you brought back Pop-Rocks?
</p><p>Turk: Teddy boy!
</p><p>Across the room, Ted opens his mouth to reveal the sizzling Pop Rocks inside.
</p><p>Elliot: Yeah, well, you're not as big a trend-setter as you think you are. Right, Keith?
</p><p>She turns to Keith, who sheepishly opens his sizzling Pop Rock-filled mouth.
</p><p>Elliot: [Disappointed] Ohh.
</p><p>J.D.'s Narration: As for me, I spent my free time getting coworkers I just met pregnant.
</p><p>Cut to...
KIM'S APARTMENT
J.D. and Kim stand in the living room.
</p><p>J.D.: You're pregnant? [She nods.] Are you sure?
</p><p>Kim: [Holding up a dozen home tests] I'm pretty sure.
</p><p>J.D.: Uh, Kim, I'm not really sure how to phrase this, so I'm just gonna dive right in: Have there been other penises?
</p><p>Kim: It's yours, J.D.
</p><p>J.D.: [Not cool] Cool.
</p><p>Kim: Are you okay?
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Aaaaauuuuugggggghhhhhh!!!!!!
</p><p>J.D.: Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen the inside of your apartment before.
</p><p>Kim: Said the father of my unborn child. Heh! 
That was a joke. 
[Nothing from J.D.] 
Oh, come on. No laugh from a guy who, when he orders a coffee, says "Thanks a latte!"
</p><p>J.D.: Well, that's different, Kim, that's hilarious. This is life-changing.
</p><p>Kim: We can get through this.
</p><p>J.D.: You know what else is pretty classic -- when the coffee guy asks for money, you say, "Sorry, my wallet's in my other pair of mocha-chinos." That always gets 'em.
</p><p>Kim's beeper goes off, and she looks at it.
</p><p>Kim: Ah, dammit. I have to go to the hospital.
</p><p>J.D.: Scone is also a--a funny word; but I don't like them, I prefer croissants.
</p><p>Kim: You're clearly freaking out, so, um, you need to promise me that you're gonna find somebody to talk to about this while I'm gone.
</p><p>J.D.: Please! I'll be fine. You be careful -- you're walking for two!
</p><p>She nods and leaves.
</p><p>J.D.: [Dialing his phone] Call Turk.
</p><p>Meanwhile...

Everybody dances to Turk's ringtone.
