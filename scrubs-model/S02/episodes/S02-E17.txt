<p>The following is a transcript of the <i><a href="/wiki/Scrubs" title="Scrubs">Scrubs</a></i> episode <b>"<a href="/wiki/My_Own_Private_Practice_Guy" title="My Own Private Practice Guy">My Own Private Practice Guy</a>"</b>.
</p>Contents<p>Hospital -- Men's Room
<br>J.D. enters and sidles up to the urinal next to Dr. Cox.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Okay, you've been avoiding Dr. Cox ever since Jordan told you her baby was actually his.  But this chance meeting is a sign.  It's time to let go of the secret.  You just need to find a smooth way in.
<br>J.D.:  Hey, Dr. Cox!  Takin' a wizz?
<br>Dr. Cox:  We've been over this before, Newbie -- eyes front, no talking.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Okay, fine.  I'll just read the wall.
<br>J.D.:  "J.D. has a tiny pickle"?
<br>Dr. Cox:  Kudos for honesty, there, Newbie -- but, again, no talking.
<br>J.D.:  Dr. Cox, I have to tell you something....
<br>Jordan enters.
<br>Jordan:  Oh!  Perry, you pee standing up at work!  That is so cute!  Would you come on?  We're on a very tight schedule.
<br>J.D. whimpers vaguely.
<br>Dr. Cox finishes up and heads to the sink.
<br>Dr. Cox:  You know, Jordan, with all the baby weight you haven't lost yet, I just went ahead and assumed you'd be used to tight things by now.
<br>Jordan:  Oh, that's lovely.
<br>She notices J.D. and walks up behind him.
<br>Jordan:  Huh!  Well, hello, sailor.
<br>J.D.:  [nervous]  Ahoy.
<br>Dr. Cox walks up behind J.D.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Oh, my goodness, Newbie.  Are you so uncomfortable with Jordan here that you've, in fact, stopped peeing mid-stream?
<br>J.D.:  [uncomfortable]  I may have.
</p><p>Doctors' Lounge
<br>Turk and J.D. enter, passing Dr. Kelso at the arcade game.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Yes!
<br>J.D.:  I wonder why Dr. Cox and Jordan got divorced?  I mean, they act like they hate each other, but I think that's just for show.
<br>Turk:  Yeah, whatever.  Are you gonna stretch before we play basketball, or what?
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Turk likes to blow off steam by playing basketball before surgery.  I always get my ass kicked....  But not today.
<br>He pulls on some protective goggles.
<br>J.D.:  Grrrrrr.
<br>Cut to...
<br>The Parking Lot
<br>The ball bounces off of J.D.'s goggles.  Turk recovers the ball and sinks the basket.
<br>Turk:  And that's game!
<br>He and Todd exchange sweaty, celebratory chest bumps and grunts.
<br>J.D.:  How the hell did we lose?!  We have Chet!
<br>The extremely tall Chet passes.
<br>Chet:  Sorry, man.
<br>J.D.:  Chet, you suck!!!
<br>J.D.:  [frustrated]  AAARRRGGGHHH!!!
<br>J.D.:  You know what, some stereotypes are true, Turk.  Okay?  And, just maybe, black people are a little better at basketball.  Whatta you say?
<br>***Fantasy Sequence:  Nurse Roberts, who had been watching the game with a few other gathered staffers, has the ball.  The Harlem Globetrotters theme plays as she does some hot tricks, leaps through the air, and dunks the ball, swinging on the basket.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  HAH!
<br>****
<br>Turk:  Maybe a little.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Y'all got hockey.
</p><p>Elevator / Hall
<br>J.D. and Elliot step out and walk through.
<br>J.D.:  Why do you think they got divorced?
<br>Elliot:  Oh, I have no idea.  I just can't believe you had to pee in front of Jordan!  I could _not_ do that.  I mean, Paul's my boyfriend, and I make him turn the volume way up on the T.V. when I go.  Plus, he's not allowed in the apartment an hour before _or_ after I do twosies.
<br>J.D.:  Elliot, you're a doctor -- stop calling it "twosies."
<br>Elliot:  Oh, with patients I say "dookie."  Oh, dookie!
<br>J.D.:  What?
<br>She hurries off as Dr. Cox approaches.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Well, now, Maggie!  I can only assume that you are whiling away the morning cat-chatting with your favorite gal-pal because you've already finished your pre-rounding?
<br>J.D.:  I haven't even started yet.
<br>Dr. Cox:  What?
<br>J.D.:  Gotcha!  Finished!
<br>Dr. Cox:  That's a good one, Newbie.  My heart is racing.  You are quite the prankster.
<br>J.D.:  I could tell you some stories.
<br>Dr. Cox:  And if there's a God in heaven, you never will.  This is Mrs. Gracin's chart -- her private practice doctor just showed up, so I am off this one.
<br>He heads off.
<br>J.D.:  Well, is there anything I need to do for her lung nodule?
<br>Dr. Cox:  [from down the hall]  Oh, I don't know.  What do you say you start her on 20 CCs of It's not my problem anymore!
<br>Cut to...
<br>Mrs. Gracin's Room
<br>J.D. approaches.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Great.  Another pretentious private practice guy who's gonna order me around while he counts his money all day.
<br>He enters the room, where the private practice doctor, Pete, is at the bed of his patient, the middle-aged Mrs. Gracin.
<br>Pete:  Hey!  You must be J.D.!
<br>He grabs J.D.'s hand in a shake.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  He knows my name.
<br>Pete:  I'm Dr. Fisher -- I go by Pete.  Never call me Petey, we'll be friends for life.  Hey, look at this.  Don't believe me?  Already got you a latte, buddy.  Look at that.
<br>He hands J.D. a paper take-away cup.
<br>J.D.:  Thanks!  A latte!
<br>Pete:  That's funny!  [to the patient]  We got a good one, Sally!
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  How is that funny?  Eh, just go with it.
<br>J.D.:  You know, I'm always pulling pranks, too.  Like, before, Dr. Cox was like, "Did you do that pre-rounding?"---
<br>Pete:  You know what -- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you; I do want to hear the end of that story, though -- could you get a pulmonary consult for Sally for me?
<br>J.D.:  Yeah, we--yeah.
<br>Pete:  You're probably thinking, Why didn't you do that before I got here?  But you weren't sure if you'd be over-stepping your boundaries.  What if I was some sort of territorial ass with a giant ego -- or a territorial ego with a giant ass.  Stop me, Sally, please!
<br>J.D.:  Ha!
<br>Pete:  And you're gonna help me.  Need you to help me get Sally, here, out of bed; that way I can go back to trying to get her _into_ bed. 
<br>Sally:  [giggling]  Stop!
<br>Pete:  You stop, foxy lady!  [to J.D.]  Look, you're doing great.  From now on, just follow your instincts, okay?  [to Sally]  And you, don't flirt so much.
<br>He heads out.
<br>Sally grins at J.D.
<br>Sally:  Wanna make him jealous?
<br>J.D.:  No.  [thinks]  "Thank--thanks a latte!"  Thank--thank--well--'cau--well--well--"thanks a lot!"  [calls down the hall]  I--oh, "Thanks a latte"!  I got it!
</p><p>Nurses' Station
<br>The gang are all standing around, bored.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  At a hospital, there's always one sure way to deal with boredom.
<br>J.D.:  You guys wanna go laugh at the narcoleptic guy?
<br>They all follow him down the hall.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  I know it sounds insensitive, but let's face it -- narcolepsy is a funny condition.  And it can be triggered by a number of things....  Like stress.
<br>Shot of:  A kid in a classroom, passed out on top of his test paper.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Or anger, from, say, three double-bogeys in a row.
<br>Shot of:  A golf cart being driven across a course by a man slumped over the steering wheel.
<br>He's heard crashing into the water trap.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Or...in Mr. Hilliard's case....
<br>The gang are outside the man's room, looking through the observation window.
<br>Turk:  Sexual arousal!?!
<br>Elliot:  I'm goin' in.
<br>She goes into the man's room.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Is falling asleep _after_ sex considered narcolepsy?  'Cause if it is, Mr. Roberts got it.
<br>Carla laughs.
<br>They all turn their attention back to the window, where Elliot is playing for Mr. Hilliard's attention.
<br>J.D.:  Okay, so, first she's gonna stick her chest out...and then she'll toss her hair....
<br>Carla:  That's sexy.
<br>Turk:  And, drop!
<br>Elliot drops her pen.
<br>Elliot:  Oh!  Oops!
<br>She bends over, giving the patient a nice view of her rear.
<br>His head falls -- he's fast asleep.
<br>J.D.:  Oh, that did it.
<br>They clap.
<br>Elliot does a little victory dance.
<br>Elliot:  Hell yeah!
<br>Cut to...
<br>Hall
<br>Carla and Elliot are walking through (probably back from Mr. Hilliard's room).
<br>Elliot:  I have a boyfriend, work is going well, I actually feel cute for the first time in my life; my self-esteem cannot be touched!
<br>Carla:  It's been so weird since I got engaged.
<br>Elliot:  Oh, you're right -- I'll never get married!  Message received!
<br>Carla:  Elliot!  This is about me.
<br>Elliot:  Oh, really?
<br>Carla:  Yeah.
<br>Elliot:  Ohh, 'kay.
<br>Carla:  It's like, I don't feel attractive at all lately.  Like I've lost my spark or something.
<br>Elliot:  Oh, please!  Remember what Kelso said about your hair yesterday?
<br>***Flashback:  Dr. Kelso faces the camera.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  It makes you look frumpy!
<br>****
<br>Elliot:  I thought he said "clumpy"!
<br>Carla:  How is that better?
<br>Elliot:  ...I--
<br>Carla:  You don't know.
</p><p>Parking Lot
<br>Dr. Kelso pulls into his space, where Turk and Todd were just about to play ball.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Morning, boys!
<br>Turk:  Sir?  This is where we play.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Funny.  I thought this was where we worked?
<br>He gets out and sets his alarm.
<br>Turk:  Dr. Kelso, I have a low-anterior resection later on this afternoon, and I'd really like to exercise in order to be at my best.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Well...I'd really like to have grand-kids someday, but the last five Christmases, my son has brought his roommate Brad home!  So, you tell me whether life is fair.
<br>He heads into the building.
</p><p>I.C.U.
<br>J.D. and Pete approach the Nurses' Station.
<br>J.D.:  I can't believe you did your residency here, too!
<br>Pete:  You kidding me?  We lived, we loved, we sang to each other, for crying out loud.  Hey, Laverne, remember the time you and I got a little crazy, right?  Went down to the waterfall, stripped off our scrubs, dove in.  You remember that, Laverne?
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Are you hittin' the crack-pipe?
<br>Pete:  [to J.D.]  See, that's the kind of magic I'm talking about, buddy!
<br>Dr. Cox arrives. 
<br>Dr. Cox:  Hey, ladies.
<br>J.D.:  Oh, you two must already know each other.
<br>Pete:  Dr. Cox.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Petey.
<br>The two stare each other down.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Sometimes, when you're in an awkward situation, the best thing to do is to go to your happy place.
<br>***Fantasy Sequence:  'The Tonight Show'
<br>Jay Leno is doing his monologue.
<br>Jay Leno:  ...Well, it's not uncommon!  I think a lot of people keep, uh, plants in their apartment.  Right, J.D.?
<br>The audience laughs as Jay looks over to his band leader, J.D., who sits in Kevin Eubanks' place with a guitar.
<br>J.D.:  [laughing]  Oh, Jay!  You're so crazy!
<br>He does a mad riff on the guitar.
<br>****
<br>Pete and Dr. Cox are still staring at each other.
<br>Pete:  We have a little history....  Yeah....
<br>Without a word, Cox walks away.
<br>J.D.:  What's up his pooper?
<br>Pete:  Actually, I think he's mad 'cause I went into private practice and he's stuck in this hell-hole.
<br>J.D.:  Yeah.
<br>Pete and J.D. turn to walk down the hall.
<br>Pete:  You wouldn't believe this, but that guy was my mentor, man.  I mean, I lived and breathed for that guy's approval.
<br>J.D.:  That's lame.
<br>Pete:  I know!  Once you learn the tricks, though, he's easier to deal with; you'll see.
<br>J.D.:  Tell me about it.
<br>Pete:  [laughing]  Yeah!
<br>J.D.:  No, no, I'm serious -- tell me about it.
<br>Pete:  Oh!  Ohh.  Uh, well, you know when he gets on his rants, he gets all hyped up, his vein starts sticking out of his neck, and he starts yelling at ya -- when he's done, just look at him, stare him right in the eye, and say, "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
<br>J.D. laughs.
<br>Pete:  I don't know why, but it works; trust me.
<br>J.D.:  No, I do.  Now, how do you get him to stop calling you girl's names.
<br>Pete:  Girl's names?
<br>J.D.:  Oh.  Nevermind.
</p><p>Another Hall
<br>Elliot is rushing through.  He pager pops off her belt.
<br>Elliot:  Pukers!  
<br>She snatches it up off the floor, blowing her fallen hair out of her face.
<br>Elliot:  I gotta get this thing fixed.
<br>The Janitor steps up to her.
<br>Janitor:  Allow me!  May I?
<br>He takes the pager and begins adjusting it with a tool.
<br>Janitor:  Ah, yep.  See, what you got here is a Medi-Com XJ.  Got this hip-guard on it -- I'm guessing it's always, uh, coming loose?
<br>Elliot:  It _is_ always coming loose!
<br>Janitor:  I've been there; I've seen it; I fixed it.  Without a try, missy.
<br>He hands it back with a smile.
<br>Elliot:  Thank you!
<br>Janitor:  Oh, for what?  For doing my job?  Come on!  This kind of thing gets me up in the morning.  That, and the smell of urinal cakes. 
<br>He laughs heartily.
<br>Elliot joins in.
<br>Janitor:  Anyway, I'll see you around!  Have a good one!
<br>Elliot:  Back at'cha!
<br>They part ways with a grin.
<br>Further down the hall, Elliot passes J.D.
<br>J.D.:  What are you smiling about?
<br>Elliot:  Oh, I just made a new friend!
<br>She continues on, and J.D. looks back down the hall at the Janitor, who is happily humming a little tune as he mops.
</p><p>Doctor's Lounge
<br>Turk is hanging out with Todd as he tries another outlet for relieving his stress -- playing Miss PacMan.
<br>Turk:  This is so unfair of Kelso.  Everyone has gotta have a way of taking the edge off!  You and I, we've got basketball.  Nurse Roberts, she's got her stories.
<br>Todd:  Some guy named D.R.K. must love Miss PacMan, 'cause he's got the high score of 41 million.
<br>Turk:  D.R.K.?  [thinks]  Dr. Kelso!
<br>***Fantasy/Surreal Sequence:  Dr. Kelso toddles through the hospital like a video-game character, making little "wocka-wocka-wocka" noises -- punctuated by the occasional score-improving "plblbling!"
<br>****
<br>Todd:  [as he plays]  Ohh, Miss PacMan, I would sex that bow right off your head!  Eat those dots, you naughty, naughty girl!
</p><p>I.C.U. / Nurses' Station
<br>J.D. comes up to Dr. Cox.
<br>J.D.:  Hey, Dr. Cox.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Oh, hey, buddy!  I was just thinking about you!  Yeah, I was thinking how it might be real nice to have somebody around here who could help me out.  You know, somebody I could call -- oh, gosh -- "My Resident"...and we'd do stuff together.  You know, medical stuff.  And it would just be peaches!  But then it occurred to me that a guy who looked a hell of a lot like you used to be that guy.  
<br>Monica!  Just because you have a new buddy doesn't mean you can  all of a sudden drop all your regular duties.  And I know I just said "drop your duties," and, so help me God, if you even smile, I will crush you into two little newbie-cubes and hang you from rearview mirror.  Whatta you gotta say for yourself?
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Just do it!
<br>J.D.:  I'm sorry...did you say something?
<br>***Fantasy Sequence: Pete steps into the frame of a close-up of Dr. Cox.
<br>He has a pointer.
<br>Pete:  Welcome to today's lecture:  The Biomechanical Reaction of Dr. Perry Cox When He's Not Being Listened To.
<br>Stage One:  The jaw-clench.  Arrrrrrrrggggggggghhhhhhhh!
<br>Dr. Cox clenches his jaw in frustration.
<br>Pete:  Quickly followed by Stage Two:  Syllable elongation.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Newbie, I re-he-heally don't have time to repeat myself!
<br>Pete:  Finally, Stage Three:  Dr. Cox begrudgingly offers a little respect, but then distances himself by overusing the word "there."
<br>Dr. Cox:  But, I gotta give it to you, there, for yanking my chain, there.  There!
<br>Pete:  The young soldier is offered a prize for his courage.
<br>Get ready!
<br>****
<br>Dr. Cox:  I'll tell you what, there, Newbie:  If you want to stick around and help me out with Mrs. Riley's pericardiocentesis after work, that'd be great.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  I knew this was his way of reaching out, but still....
<br>J.D.:  I have plans tonight.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Oh, what plans!?
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Okay, think of something believable.  Grandma died!  No, no, no, no, don't do that...because if she does die, you'll feel awful; and, let's face it, she's no spring chicken.  I should call her.  But then, whenever we talk, I have nothing to say -- how 'bout asking me how I am for once!
<br>Dr. Cox:  [whistles]  Newbie!  
<br>J.D.:  My grandma died!
<br>He runs off.
</p><p>Mr. Hilliard's Room
<br>He's watching TV.  Carla enters, her sexuality at full throttle.
<br>Carla:  Hello, Mr. Hilliard.
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  Hey.
<br>Carla:  Just wanna make sure you're comfortable!
<br>She puts her breasts in his face as she fluffs his pillow.
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  Who are you?
<br>Carla:  [seductively]  They call me Carla.
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  Okay, Carla it is.
<br>He goes back to the TV, even though she's leaned over inches from his face.
<br>Carla:  Mr. Hilliard...
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  Mm-hmm?
<br>Carla:  Do I have something on my...[licks her lips]...lips?
<br>He looks.
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  Nope!  Totally clean.
<br>She gives up.
</p><p>Bar
<br>J.D. and Pete are hanging out.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  I felt guilty about blowing off Dr. Cox to grab a beer with Pete.  Of course, that was before we got Nancy as our waitress!
<br>Pete is talking up the hot waitress.
<br>Pete:  Nancy, the kid's a doctor, for crying out loud!  He saves lives!  That's worthy of your respect, or at least one drunken weekend in Vegas.
<br>J.D.:  [whispering to Pete]  Three-day weekend!
<br>Pete:  Three-day weekend!  Columbus day!  That's coming up, right?  Come on!
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Everyone deals with problems in their own way.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Some lash out at others...
<br>Dr. Kelso finds the cord of his beloved Miss PacMan machine has been cut.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  ...some just end up lashing out at themselves...
<br>Carla stares dourly at her reflection.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  ...and some people just try to hide.
<br>Dr. Cox enters the bar.
<br>J.D. ducks behind the pool table.
<br>Dr. Cox:  [cheerily to the waitress]  Nancy!  [bitterly to J.D.]  Nancy.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Unfortunately, that never works.
</p><p>Admissions -- Front Desk -- The Next Day
<br>J.D. comes up to Dr. Cox, who is behind the desk, going over a chart.
<br>J.D.:  Hey, Dr. Cox?  Look, I'm so sorry I lied to you last night.  I should've just told you I was getting a beer with Pete.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Did we just slip into some alternate dimension where I actually give a flying ducky about what you say and do?
<br>J.D.:  Look, I know that he's in private practice and everything, but Pete's actually a really cool guy.
<br>Dr. Cox:  He is a bad guy; and Newbie, if you're smart, you'll stay away from him.
<br>J.D.:  Ohhh, my God!  You're actually jealous that I'm hanging out with another doctor!
<br>Dr. Cox:  No, I'm _not_.
<br>J.D.:  Laverne?
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Jealous!
<br>J.D.:  Ta-DOW!
<br>Dr. Cox:  Look, Marcia, if I were you, I'd drop this jealousy thing right now.
<br>J.D.:  Don't worry about it, champ.  It's all right to need me.
<br>He walks away, and Dr. Cox lunges across the desk at J.D.  He misses....
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Touchdown!
</p><p>Administration Desk
<br>Elliot comes up to Carla, who is looking rather depressed.
<br>Elliot:  Hi, Happy!
<br>Carla:  I'm hideous.  I can't even get Todd to make a sex joke.  Watch this.
<br>They turn around to Todd, who is looking over a chart.
<br>Carla:  Hey, Todd?  I'm all out of the extra-long tongue depressors -- do you happen to have one for me?
<br>Todd:  Sorry, Carla, I'm all out.
<br>They turn back around.
<br>Elliot:  How did he not say, "Yeah, in my pants"?!?
<br>Carla:  God!  I don't know what is so different about me since I got engaged!
<br>She fiddles with her engagement ring, twisting it off.
<br>Todd:  Wait, I found one.  It's not made of wood...but give me a minute!
<br>Carla slips her ring back on.
<br>Todd:  Hey, have you checked Mr. Oberman for hypertension?
<br>She slips the ring off again.
<br>Todd:  Because I've got hypertension right here!
<br>Elliot:  [whispering to Carla] No. Way!
<br>Ring off...
<br>Todd:  [giggling]  Boobies!
<br>Ring on...
<br>Todd:  [serious]  Charts.
</p><p>Cafeteria
<br>Dr. Kelso stalks over to Turk's table.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  I know it was you!
<br>Turk pulls out the frayed end of the power cord.
<br>Turk:  You mean this right here?  This is mine from home!
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Forty million, son!  Do you have any idea how many patients I had to ignore to get that high score?  People died!
<br>Turk:  Well, what about me, sir?  I need to play basketball.  Now, come on, since you lost that stupid game, aren't you more stressed out than usual?
<br>***Flashback:  The Elevator
<br>Dr. Kelso is angrily beating his fists on the closed doors to speed them up.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  OPEN!  OPEN, OPEN, OPEN!
<br>****
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Maybe a little.
<br>Turk:  So, what do we do now?
<br>Cut to...
<br>Golf Course
<br>Dr. Kelso and Turk are there.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Now, this is how you relieve stress.
<br>He sets up his shot and swings.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  DAMMIT TO HELL!
</p><p>Hall / Nurses' Station
<br>J.D. and Elliot are walking through.
<br>J.D.:  So you're saying the Janitor's a nice person?
<br>Elliot:  He is such a sweetie!
<br>J.D.:  I'm gonna ask him an innocuous little question, and his answer will be filled with hate.  Just filled with it!
<br>They stop next to the Janitor, who is mopping.
<br>J.D.:  How's it goin'?
<br>Janitor:  Very well, sir!  Thank you for asking!  How are you?
<br>J.D.:  [to Elliot]  Do you not see the hate?
<br>Elliot:  What is wrong with you?
<br>She walks off.
<br>J.D.:  That was a good one.
<br>Janitor:  I think so.
<br>J.D. starts to walk off, but the Janitor props the mop against the side of the desk to block him.
<br>Janitor:  All right, go.
<br>He blocks J.D. again.
<br>Janitor:  Hold it!  Nah.
<br>He blocks again.
<br>J.D.:  He's doing it!
</p><p>Doctor's Lounge
<br>Dr. Cox is on one of the couches, watching a game on the TV.
<br>Pete comes in.
<br>Pete:  What's the deal, there, Alpha Dog?  You ever gonna cut me some slack?
<br>Dr. Cox:  Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey, Petey....
<br>Pete:  Okay, good answer.  Look, uh, I understand you're seeing Jordan again -- I just wanted to tell you, seriously, good for you.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Would you like to know what would be seriously good for you?
<br>Pete:  More bran in my diet?
<br>Dr. Cox:  No, how 'bout you never mention Jordan again.
<br>J.D. rushes in.
<br>J.D.:  Hey!  Do you guys mind if I turn on CNN?  My grandma bought me a stock -- I wanna see how it's doing.
<br>Pete:  Look at Rockefeller!  Pass me the remote, buddy!
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Cool!  These guys are finally starting to get along!
<br>Dr. Cox flings the remote across the room.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  ...Or not.
<br>Pete:  No big deal!  I'll, uh, you know, do one of these -- change the channel.
<br>He heads over to the T.V.
<br>Dr. Cox flies out of his seat and tackles Pete, throwing him to the floor.
<br>J.D.:  Or...we could just...leave it on this station....
</p><p>Mr. Hilliard's Room
<br>Carla is talking to the man.
<br>Carla:  Mr. Hilliard, I like my body.
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  Okay.
<br>Carla:  I didn't always.  I remember when I was ten years old, my swim coach telling me that my butt stuck out of the water too much.  But now?  I like it when my boyfriend looks at my wagon and goes "BAM!" you know?  I'm okay with my curves!  I realize women inject God-knows-what into their face to have lips like mine!  Mr. Hilliard!  I can hop out of the shower and look at my naked body for a whole ten seconds without totally losing it -- that's more than most women!  But, still, when I can't make you fall asleep, it's like hearing my swim coach's voice all over again; and my body doesn't deserve that.
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  So, what do you want me to do?
<br>Carla:  Fall asleep.
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  I'm not attracted to you!
<br>Carla:  WHY!?!
<br>Mr. Hilliard:  Because you remind me of my sister!
<br>Carla:  But I'm _not_ your sister!
<br>At that, the man collapses, fast asleep.
<br>Carla:  That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
</p><p>Doctors' Lounge
<br>Dr. Cox gets up off the floor, brushing his hands after his accomplishment with the tackle.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Had to be done.
<br>Pete struggles to his feet.
<br>Pete:  Okay!  Terrific!  Grown-ups tackle each other all the time.
<br>Perry, I can't change what already happened, but you gotta believe me -- I never meant to come between you and anyone.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Watching Dr. Cox and Pete fight over me was -- aw, hell, I'll say it:  It was awesome!
<br>Dr. Cox:  You went ahead and took something that did not belong to you.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  That seemed a little possessive...but I'm flattered!
<br>Dr. Cox:  And worse than that, you did it knowing full-well just exactly how I felt about her.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Ahh, he just wouldn't be Dr. Cox if he didn't refer to me as a 'her.'
<br>Pete:  Hey, for what it's worth, I didn't make the first move.
<br>J.D.:  That's a lie!  You bought me a latte!
<br>They look at J.D.
<br>J.D.:  Hey, guys.
<br>Dr. Cox:  We were having problems.  Problems that you knew all about because I confided in you.  And what did you do with the information?  You used it to get Jordan into bed, didn't you.  Didn't you!
<br>Pete:  Perry, come on.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Go.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  And, finally, the reason Dr. Cox and his wife got divorced became abundantly clear.
<br>Pete leaves.
</p><p>The Golf Course
<br>Dr. Kelso and Turk are finishing their game.
<br>Turk has putted his ball.
<br>Turk:  Yes!  Get in there!
<br>It goes in.
<br>Turk:  Say it!
<br>Dr. Kelso:  I'm your bitch.
<br>Turk:  Don't be too hard on yourself, sir!  You only been playing this game for, like, fifty-six years!
<br>A security guard named Dave pulls up to them in a golf cart.
<br>Dave:  Dr. Kelso, is this young man a guest of yours?
<br>Dr. Kelso thinks a moment.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Dave, I've never seen him before in my life!
<br>Dave:  Really?
<br>Dave gets out of his cart and heads over to Turk.
<br>Turk:  Dave....  Hey, man, you--you--you--you don't gotta---
<br>Dave:  Oh, yeah, I do.
<br>Turk runs away.
<br>Dave:  Don't you run from me!  Don't!  Hey!
<br>Turk:  DR. KELSO!
<br>Dave:  Hey!  Hey!
<br>They continue running around.
</p><p>Hospital -- Hall
<br>Pete catches up with J.D.
<br>Pete:  Hey, hey!  Jack Daniels!  What's crackin'?  Look, my hot cousin, her volleyball team has a game tonight -- tall girls, tiny shorts -- you in?
<br>J.D.:  Uhh, I think I'm gonna pass.
<br>Pete:  Ohh, I get it, all right -- you're still in Perr-a-reeno's corner.  But that's okay, buddy!  Look, just a word to the wise, all right?  Just be careful who you hitch your wagon to.  I mean that.  [he spies a hot nurse]  Yikes!  I gotta go, okay?
<br>He catches up to the nurse.
<br>Pete:  Hi!  Could I buy you a house?
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  I guess sometimes it comes down to loyalty.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Men's Room
<br>J.D. comes up to the urinal next to Dr. Cox.
<br>J.D.:  Hey, Dr. Cox!
<br>Dr. Cox:  Still no talking in the bathroom, Newbie.
<br>He flushes and heads over to the sink.
<br>Dr. Cox:  You know what's weird?
<br>J.D.:  That you're allowed to talk?
<br>Dr. Cox:  I never blamed Jordan.  I was a chief resident, I was here all the time, and I always made damn-sure she knew she came second.  But, God almighty, I'm trying harder this time.  I just hope I'm doing the right thing, you know?
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Who cares if Jordan wants to keep it a secret?  Tell him it's his baby!  Scream it from the mountains!
<br>J.D.:  DR. COX!
<br>The door opens, and Jordan enters.
<br>Jordan:  Oh, there you are!
<br>Dr. Cox:  Hey, babe.
<br>Jordan:  Hi, handsome.  How are you?
<br>They kiss.
<br>She spies J.D. and comes up behind him.
<br>Jordan:  Oh!  Hello, D.J.
<br>J.D.:  [through clenched teeth]  Hey, Jordan.  How' ya doin'?
<br>Dr. Cox comes up behind him, and peers over his shoulder.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Oh!
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Around here, you have to grab hold of the littlest victories.
<br>J.D. does his best to be victorious over his urine-halting discomfort.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Whether it's victories over your insecurities....
<br>Cut to... Hall
<br>Carla walks confidently through.  She smiles as different male staffers check her out.
<br>Cut to...Golf Course
<br>Dr. Kelso laughs as a couple of security guards lead Turk away.
<br>Turk:  Doc-Doc-Dr. Kelso?
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  ...or security's victories over you.
<br>Turk breaks free.
<br>Turk:  Dr. Kelso!
<br>The security guards wrestle him to the ground.  Dr. Kelso laughs even harder.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Either way, you gotta choose your battles.
<br>Cut to... Hall
<br>J.D. hauls Elliot over to the Janitor.
<br>J.D.:  I want you to tell her the truth, dammit.  All right?  Tell her that you're a surly, devious, horrible excuse for a human being!
<br>A little kid comes from around the corner next to the Janitor.
<br>J.D.:  Who's that?
<br>The Janitor puts his arm around the kid.
<br>Janitor:  It's my son.
<br>Elliot:  Oh, my God, J.D.!
<br>She goes off, totally repulsed.
<br>J.D.:  I-I'm sorry.  I di--no, I didn't even see him there, I---
<br>Janitor:  No, no, no, I'm...I'm glad he heard it.  I think it's important he sees how the world treats people like us.
<br>J.D.:  I'm so sorry.
<br>He goes off, feeling totally awful.
<br>The Janitor looks down at the boy.
<br>Janitor:  Who the hell are you?  Go on, beat it.  
<br>He goes back to his work.
<br>The kid just stands there.
<br>Janitor:  Scram!  
<br>The kid doesn't move.
<br>Janitor:  ...All right, stick around.
