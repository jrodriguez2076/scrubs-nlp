</p>Contents<p><br>
I.C.U.
<br>Dr. Cox and Jordan -- who is pushing the baby in a stroller -- are walking through.  They stop next to where J.D. is.
<br>Jordan:  I can't believe you're bitching 'cause I asked you to look after him for an hour three days a week!  Do you know how badly I need a massage?
<br>Dr. Cox:  What's the matter?  Are you getting all sore around that hump above your butt where your tail used to be?
<br>Jordan:  I'm going 'cause when Gustavo promises me something will feel great and last an hour, he doesn't end up in the shower five minutes later thinking he made me see God!
<br>Dr. Cox:  [pointing to self]  So not Gustav!  Busy doctor!
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  I think Dr. Cox would be more willing to help if he knew it was his baby.
<br>J.D. leans over to look at the baby.
<br>***Fantasy Sequence:  The baby's got Dr. Cox face.  Really.
<br>Baby:  [with Cox voice]  Whatta you say, there, Stephanie; how about _you_ step up to the plate and tell the guy.  My God!  I'm only three weeks old, and already I've got more stones than you do -- and one of mine hasn't even dropped yet.
<br>J.D.:  It's not my place to tell!
<br>Baby:  [mocking]  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!
<br>****
<br>Dr. Cox:  Newbie, I know that your ovaries are absolutely tingling at the very sight of this little fella, but you gotta snap out of it!
<br>J.D.:  Oh, I gotta get to that funeral.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Well, raise my rent if you're not off to see Tasty Coma Wife, aren't you!  [explaining to Jordan]  Her husband was in a coma so long, that she actually forgot what an attractive male looked like -- enter Errol Flynn...whose conscience will not allow him to either swash or buckle her.  But, since hubby is now worm food, I'm guessing all bets are off?  Mm-hmm?
<br>Jordan:  Listen, later on, if you have trouble getting the baby to sleep?  Just tell him that story.  Yeah.
<br>J.D.:  Well...I'm gonna get going.
<br>He escapes.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Luckily, no one else'll bust my chops about the funeral.  Because around here, you tend to get wrapped up in your own world.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Whether you're trying to plan your day...
<br>J.D. passes Todd talking to himself.
<br>Todd:  Should I take a dookie before or after I lift weights?  Mmmm....after!
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  ...or trying to live out your deepest fantasies.
<br>J.D. passes an empty room, where the Janitor is playing doctor -- his mop is playing patient.
<br>Janitor:  Dammit!  Don't you die on me!  [grabs defibrillator paddles] Clear!  Kgh-bgghhhh!  
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  ...Maybe you're trying to break in the soles of your new Italian shoes...
<br>J.D. stops to allow Dr. Kelso to walk stiffly past, with Ted the Lawyer in tow.
<br>Lawyer:  Sir, those shoes look a little small for you.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  ...or break down the spirit of your old whipping boy.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  What do you know about appearances, Ted?  Have you looked in a mirror?
<br>Ted stops.
<br>Lawyer:  Not lately.  But when I do, it's reflection perfection!
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  One way or another, everyone finds a way to make it all about themselves.
<br>J.D. comes up to the Nurses' Station.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  I gotta fix my own damn copy machine 'cause the maintenance man claims he's got more important things to do!
<br>J.D.:  Isn't he fixing the heat down in Pediatrics?
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Whatever!
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  As for me, no matter what Dr. Cox thinks, I wasn't going to that funeral to hit on Jamie.... 
<br>Cut to...
<br>The Funeral Home
<br>J.D., wearing a nice dark suit and tie, comes down the stairs to the parlor.  
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  ...I was going to pay my respects.
<br>He trips down the last few steps.  He quickly picks himself up and approaches Jamie.
<br>Jamie:  J.D.!  I'm so happy you came!
<br>J.D.:  Well, you look fantastic!  And, you know, I don't mean "Hey, dude, check out that hot bitty at the bar!" 'fantastic' -- I'm talking about "I'm sorry for your loss" 'fantastic'.
<br>Jamie:  Do you wanna grab a drink?
<br>J.D.:  Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.
<br>Jamie:  Oh, I was actually talking about him.
<br>She points to the waiter behind J.D., who is holding a tray of drinks.
<br>J.D.:  Oh, yeah, I know!  So--so was I.
<br>He grabs one of the glasses and takes a sip.
<br>Jamie:  Oh, no!  You have to order -- he's bussing those.
<br>J.D. spits the contents back into the glass.
<br>J.D.:  Somebody's a smoker!
<br>Jamie:  Heh.
<br>Meanwhile...
<br>The Hospital -- Doctor's Lounge
<br>Carla and Elliot hover over Turk who is sound asleep on one of the couches.
<br>Carla:  Awww...look at my baby sleep.  Isn't he an angel?  I wonder what's going on in that shiny head of his?
<br>Turk makes little whimpering noises in his sleep.
<br>***Turk's Dream:  Exam Room
<br>Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" fills the scene of Turk, lying naked on the table.  Nurse Elliot -- in full kink mode, barely wearing her microscopic uniform -- approaches him.
<br>Turk is rather surprised as she climbs onto the table with him, blowing a bubble with her gum, and dancing her fingers over his chest as she straddles him.
<br>Elliot:  This'll only hurt a little.
<br>She winks.
<br>Turk:  O...kay.
<br>She kisses him.
<br>****
<br>Back at The Funeral Home...
<br>J.D. is preparing to leave.
<br>Jamie:  Thanks again for coming.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Just get out without doing any more damage.
<br>J.D.:  I had a blast.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Nice job!
<br>Jamie:  Well...goodbye....
<br>She bites her lip, looking sad that he's leaving.
<br>J.D.:  I'll see ya.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Closet
<br>J.D. slams Jamie against the far wall as they passionately make out, pulling each other's clothes off, to the leftover strains of "Let's Get It On"
<br>Flash to...
<br>Doctor's Lounge
<br>***Turk and Elliot continue making out on the exam table in his dream.
<br>****
<br>He awakes with a start and shouts in alarm at the sight of Carla, then screams when he notices Elliot.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Men's Room
<br>Ted catches sight of his reflection...and screams.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Vacant Room
<br>There's a short in the Janitor's defibrillator paddles, and he's shocked...he screams.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Dr. Kelso is looking at his bloodied foot, injured by his new shoes...and screams.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Men's Room
<br>Ted is still screaming.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Nurses' Station
<br>Nurse Roberts meets misfortune with her attempt to fix the copy machine...and screams.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Gym
<br>Todd is pressing some heavy weights.  He screams under the pressure...and farts.
<br>Todd:  Whoops!
<br>Flash back to...
<br>Funeral Home -- Parlor
<br>The gathered family and friends are startled by Jamie's orgasmic screams from the closet.
<br>After a moment, a disheveled J.D. sticks his head out the closet door to explain.
<br>J.D.:  Oh!  Oh!  Heh.  I'm sorry, everyone.  I...I dropped something on my toe.  [screams to imitate Jamie] "Ahhhhhh!...AHHAAAAHHHH!"  ...You know....  Carry on.
<br>He closes the door again, grabbing a flower out of the arrangement next to him on the way.
</p><p><br>The Funeral Home -- Closet
<br>J.D. stands around awkwardly as Jamie puts her clothes back on.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Okay, she's probably feeling awful, so say something reassuring.
<br>J.D.:  You're going to hell.
<br>Jamie:  J.D., we've been over this.  I loved my husband, but he's been dead to me for two years.  I mean, I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have some closure.  ...And my first orgasm in, like, forever!
<br>J.D.:  You know, Jamie, there are a lot of ways to grieve.  Um.... But, last time I checked, wheelbarrow-style wasn't one of them.
<br>Jamie:  I am okay, J.D.  I'm really seeing things clearly.
<br>J.D.:  You've never been more confused.
<br>Jamie:  I'm happy!
<br>J.D.:  You're sad.
<br>Jamie:  I'm at peace.
<br>J.D.:  You're at war!
<br>Jamie:  I think it's really cute that you're worried about me.  [kisses him]  But when am I gonna see you again?
</p><p><br>Hospital
<br>Jordan and Dr. Cox are walking through the I.C.U. to the elevator.  He's pushing the baby in the stroller.
<br>Jordan:  All right, I will see you at home in about an hour.  Remember to keep him warm, support his head, check his diaper every fifteen minutes; no bouncing around, no loud noise, no TV, no poking the soft spot.  And, Perry, you're the only one in my life that I actually have to say this to:  Do not yell at, demean, insult, criticize, humiliate, or mock the baby.
<br>Dr. Cox:  What are you talking about?
<br>The baby whimpers.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Waaaah!  [to Jordan]  Now, have you bothered to name this thing yet?
<br>Jordan:  I'm thinking of naming him after my father.
<br>Dr. Cox:  "Tax E. Vader"?
<br>Jordan:  Quinn.
<br>Dr. Cox:  What about a heterosexual name, like Jack?
<br>Jordan:  You're right, Percival, "Quinn" is a foofy name.
<br>Dr. Cox:  You know what, skip "Jack" altogether and just go with whatever you think is right -- whatever makes you comfortable.
<br>Flash to...
<br>Dr. Cox's Apartment
<br>He's on the couch, hovering over the baby.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack...Jack!
<br>The name means nothing to the kid.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Nothin', huh?  Aye-aye-aye.
<br>He grabs the remote and flips on the TV.
<br>Dr. Cox:  [remembering]  Oh! 
<br>He flips it off again.
<br>Dr. Cox:  My God, this is so boring!
</p><p><br>Cafeteria
<br>Carla, Turk, and Elliot are at a table.
<br>While Carla is going over some lists, Turk uncomfortably watches Elliot make love to an ice cream sundae.
<br>Carla:  Turk....
<br>Turk:  Yeah?
<br>Carla:  Between my list of family and friends and your list of family and friends, we have like 400 people coming to this wedding!  How are we gonna cut this down?
<br>Elliot:  Out of curiosity, whose list did I end up on, yours or Turk's?
<br>Carla looks over the lists.
<br>Carla:  Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........mine!
<br>Elliot:  Let me see!
<br>She reaches for the papers, but Carla holds them away.
<br>Carla:  Nope!
<br>Elliot:  Uh!
<br>Carla:  I gotta go!
<br>She jumps up from the table and leaves.
<br>Elliot:  What's her problem?  I'm starting to wonder if my prescription deodorant isn't working!
<br>Turk:  Mm?
<br>Elliot:  It's not for the odor, it's for the wetness.  See!
<br>She rubs her hand under her arm and pushes her fingers towards Turk.  He jumps back.
<br>Turk:  Whoa!  Woman!  Don't touch me!
<br>Elliot:  You're right.  I have got to stop touching my pits and rubbing them on people.
<br>Turk:  Yes, you do!  Still, it's not that....  I sorta had a sex dream about you.
<br>Elliot:  [excited]  Really?
<br>Turk:  Yeah.
<br>Elliot:  [more excited]  Was I the girl?
<br>Turk:  Yeah, you were the girl!  Can you just do me a favor, though?  Don't tell Carla about this, because she'll just get all jealous and disgusted.
<br>Elliot:  But...we haven't done anything for her to be disgusted by.
<br>Turk:  Oh, yeah, we did.
</p><p><br>J.D.'s Car -- A Country Road -- Night
<br>J.D. is driving back home from the funeral.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  I'm gonna try not to call Jamie, because I know in my heart she shouldn't be in a relationship yet.  But still, there were a lot of questions:  Was she gonna be okay?  Did I leave my underwear at the funeral home?  And -- good Lord! -- how did I end up in the middle of nowhere without realizing I've never had to pee this badly in my entire life!?
<br>He screeches to a halt and leaps out of the car.  He finds some bushes and unzips.
<br>J.D.:  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
<br>Unfortunately, the bushes he has selected are near a house...a house whose occupant has just turned on a light in one of the rooms.
<br>J.D.:  Uh!  Oh!
<br>That occupant is the Janitor.  And the room is the bathroom.
<br>J.D.:  Oh, my God!
<br>J.D. stares as the Janitor climbs into his shower and hums a merry tune as he washes.
<br>J.D.:  Oh.  My.  God.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Hospital, I.C.U. -- The Next Day
<br>J.D. and Dr. Cox are walking through.
<br>Dr. Cox:  So, you caught sight of the Janitor's window crank, and think you may have seen a little melanoma on there?  Hmm!  Well, then, it's your obligation as a doctor and your privilege as a woman to go back and ask him if you can't see it one more time.  Now, 'course I'd love to help, but I'm off to baby-sit the only other being on God's green earth who's needier than you.  And, in the meantime, I need you to go in and tell Mr. Mueller that his liver has lesions on it and it doesn't look good.
<br>He gives the chart to J.D.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Unfortunately, Mr. Mueller doesn't speak a word of English.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Mr. Mueller's Room
<br>J.D. enters.
<br>J.D.:  Hi, Mr. Mueller.
<br>Mr. Mueller: Warum so kalt hier? 
<br>Subtitles:  "Why is it so cold in here?"
<br>Mr. Mueller: Ich sollte eine Heizung dabei haben.
<br>Subtitles:  "I should have a space heater."
<br>Mr. Mueller: ...oder eine Brust Krankenschwester bei mir unter die Bettdecke.
<br>Subtitles:  "...or a big chesty nurse to climb under the covers with me."
<br>Nurse Roberts enters with a dosage of medication.
<br>Mr. Mueller:  Danke! [Thanks!]<br>Nurse Roberts:  What he "danke"in' you for?
<br>J.D.:  I don't know.  This is so frustrating!  I just wish there was some way we could connect!
<br>***Fantasy Sequence: To the tune of Nena's "99 Luftballons", J.D. and Mr. Mueller dance amid -- that's right -- 99 red balloons.
<br>****
<br>J.D.:  Nah, that would never work.
<br>Nurse Roberts leaves, with Mr. Mueller watching after her appreciatively.
</p><p><br>Dr. Cox's Apartment
<br>Boredom persuaded Dr. Cox to break a few of Jordan's rules.  He's got a beer, he's got the TV blaring a game....  He's also got Jordan coming home.
<br>He frantically ditches all evidence of his rule-breaking and zips over to the baby, who he looks at adoringly as Jordan enters.
<br>Jordan:  There's my boys!
<br>Dr. Cox:  Ohhh, has it been an hour already?
<br>Jordan:  I know!  Sometimes I get lost just looking at his face!
<br>She sits next to Perry to look at the baby.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Yeah!  Unfortunately, I'm not gonna be able to do this tomorrow on account of Kelso's got me doing a cardiology lecture.
<br>Jordan:  Oh, don't worry about it.
<br>Dr. Cox looks heavenward and mouths "Thank you!"
<br>She glances at him and he goes back to adoring the baby.
<br>Dr. Cox:  It's just tough to miss precious moments like this!
</p><p><br>Nurses' Station
<br>Carla is working behind the desk, and Elliot is stopped on the other side.
<br>Turk comes up to Carla.
<br>Turk:  Hey, Baby!
<br>Carla:  So how's it work?  You get to spend all night fantasizing about 'Nilla Wafer, here, and I get to be happy with whatever "Hey, Baby" you throw my way?  Forget it!
<br>She angrily slams down her chart and storms off.
<br>Turk turns to Elliot.
<br>Turk:  What the hell, Elliot!?
<br>Elliot:  It slipped out!  I'm sorry!
<br>Turk:  Sorry's not good enough.
<br>Elliot:  You're right.
<br>She bends over, waving her bottom at him.
<br>Elliot:  Ohhh!
<br>He spanks her -- hard.
<br>Elliot:  Oh!  HARDER, DAMMIT!  I've been bad.
<br>Turk licks his hand, and holds it up, preparing to give her another hard spank....
<br>**** 
<br>Flash to... OR
<br>Turk is holding up his hand in the middle of surgery.  The whole spanking thing was only a daydream.
<br>Surgeon:  Dr. Turk.
<br>Turk:  Huh?
<br>Surgeon:  Do you have a question?
<br>Turk:  No, sir!
<br>Surgeon:  The Todd will close.
<br>Turk:  [quietly to Todd] Dude, I'm freaking out!  I can't stop having sex dreams about Elliot!
<br>Todd:  Boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!  All done.  Continue.
<br>Turk:  Every time I close my eyes, she's doing something kinky.  Very, _very_ kinky.
</p><p><br>Men's Room
<br>J.D. enters. He sees the Janitor standing at one of the urinals.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts: This is perfect! In here, I can just "accidentally" see his wiener and then give him medical advice! Just be subtle.
<br>J.D. goes over to the urinal next to the Janitor, who is vaguely humming like a foghorn, and peers over.
<br>Janitor: Can I take your order?
<br>J.D.: How come you're not unzipped?
<br>Janitor: 'Cause I'm not peeing! This is where I come to take my breaks. If I stand around out there, everyone tells me to do stuff.
<br>J.D.: Look, uh.....[pauses to think].....Janitor--
<br>The Janitor rolls his eyes.
<br>J.D.: --I'm gonna be straight with you: I saw your penis, and I noticed a possible melanoma that you should really have checked out.
<br>Janitor: When did you see my penis?
<br>J.D.: Last night, when you were showering.
<br>Janitor: Where were you?
<br>J.D.: Oh, I was outside, in the bushes.
<br>The Janitor takes a second to process this answer.
<br>Janitor: Uhhh....
<br>J.D.: Look, it was just a coincidence, man -- I mean, i-i-if you had looked out the window, you'd have seen my penis, you know!
<br>Janitor: What!?! Why?
<br>J.D.: Because I had it out while I was looking at yours!
<br>Cut to...
<br>I.C.U.
<br>J.D. walks through.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts: Okay, regroup.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Mr. Mueller's Room
<br>J.D. enters, where another man is standing next to Mr. Mueller's bed. He approaches J.D.
<br>Hermann: Hey, you must be Dr. Dorian. I am, uh, Rolf's brother, Hermann.
<br>J.D.: Hermann the German! You must get that all the time!
<br>Hermann: No, first time....
<br>J.D.: Oh.
<br>Hermann: Let's hope it catches on!
<br>They both laugh politely.
<br>J.D.: Uh, well, uh, I could really use your help translating.
<br>Hermann: Oh, sure.
<br>They turn to Mr. Mueller and J.D. opens the chart.
<br>J.D.: Uh, I got the, uh, results back from your biopsy...
<br>Hermann: Wir werden dich zu einem... (<i>We are going to get you to...</i>)
<br>J.D.: ...the lesions in your liver...
<br>Hermann: Es sieht so aus, als ob du... (<i>It looks like you...</i>)
<br>J.D.: ...are... consistent with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
<br>Hermann: ...metastatic und pancreatic Krebs du hast. (<i>metastatic and pancreatic cancer you have.</i>)
All of the syntactic and grammar errors are sic.
<br>Mr. Mueller: Was ist denn meine Prognose? (<i>What is my prognosis?</i>)
<br>Hermann: Eh, what is the prognosis?
<br>J.D.: It's not good.
<br>Hermann: Es wird alles gut gehen. (<i>Everything is going to be fine.</i>)
<br>Mr. Mueller digests the information with a sigh.
<br>Hermann: [to J.D.] Okay.
<br>J.D.'s Narration: The key to any good relationship is communication.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Post-Op
<br>Turk has turfed his surgery patient, and is having a conversation with the man. Carla enters.
<br>Carla: Hi, Baby.
<br>Turk: Hey!
<br>He wraps his arms around her and they kiss.
<br>J.D.'s Narration: If you're not open with someone, it's gonna catch up with you.
<br>Patient: This is so weird -- I could swear that while I was in surgery, I heard you describing these sexy dreams about someone named Elliot!
<br>Carla pulls back in shock.
<br>J.D.'s Narration: If you're not honest, you'll end up getting busted.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Parking Lot
<br>Dr. Cox is playing basketball with a few other doctors.
<br>Jordan arrives with the baby.
<br>Dr. Cox stops and spins the ball on his finger.
<br>Dr. Cox: [covering] So, to summarize: If this basketball was a non ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Glycoprotein 2B3A inhibitors would be initiated early on.... 
<br>His game mates look at him impatiently.
<br>Dr. Cox: [to Jordan] You buying this?
<br>Jordan: No. Can I see that?
<br>She takes the ball and leaves.
<br>J.D.'s Narration: Eh, but what do I know about good relationships? Two days ago, I had funeral sex.
<br>Cut to...
<br>I.C.U. -- Nurses' Station
<br>J.D. comes across Elliot.
<br>Elliot: Hey! I just met your patient, Mr. Mueller; we had such a nice chat.
<br>J.D.: You speak German?
<br>Elliot: Yeah! I can do a sweet little milkmaid: Guten Morgen, möchten Sie die Kühe melken? (<i>Good morning, do you want to milk the cows?</i>)  
<br>Elliot: I can do an evil old hausfrau (<i>housewife</i>): ESS DEIN SCHNITZEL, SONST KRIEGST DU KEIN NACHTISCH! (<i>EAT YOUR SCHNITZEL, OR YOU WON'T GET ANY DESSERT!</i>)<br>J.D.: German's such a beautiful language.... Anyhoo, I think Mr. Mueller's so amazing. I mean, yesterday, I pretty much told him he was gonna die; and his brother turned to him and he said, "Es wird alles wieder gut." And Mr. Mueller just accepted it!
<br>Elliot: Well, why wouldn't he? "Es wird alles wieder gut" means "You're going to be fine."
<br>J.D. looks back into Mr. Mueller's room. The man gives a happy thumb's up, and Elliot returns it.
<br>J.D.: Germans!
</p><p><br>Nurses' Station
<br>Elliot and J.D. are there, as Mr. Mueller is wheeled back to his room, ostensibly from a round of tests.
<br>Mr. Mueller:  [to Elliot] Sobald ich nach Hause komme, werde ich eine ganze Schokoladentorte essen!!
<br>Elliot laughs.
<br>J.D.:  Please tell me he just said, "My brother told me the truth, and I'm dealing with it the best that I can."
<br>Elliot:  He said, "As soon as I get home, I'm eating an entire chocolate cake."
<br>Mr. Mueller's brother passes through on his way back to the man's room.
<br>J.D.:  You mind telling me why you lied to your brother about this ____ condition!?
<br>Hermann:  You--you talk too fast.
<br>Elliot:  He said, &lt;A name title="Why did you lie to your brother?"&gt;"Warum haben sie ihren Bruder angelogen?"&lt;/A&gt;
<br>Hermann:  &lt;A name title="I didn't want to scare my brother, asshole!"&gt;Ich wollte meinen Bruder nicht Angst machen. Arschloch.&lt;/A&gt;
<br>Elliot:  He didn't want to upset his brother, jackass!
<br>J.D.:  Fine, just tell him that lying to his brother isn't gonna make him any better!
<br>Nurse Roberts interrupts the conversation to give J.D. a chart.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  We got Mr. Mueller's ultrasound back.
<br>J.D.:  [reading]  His Biliary obstruction's relieved, and he's taking P.O.
<br>Hermann:  That's good, yes?
<br>J.D.:  Da!
<br>Elliot:  [translating J.D.'s Russian]  Ja.
<br>Hermann:  Ah!
</p><p><br>Hall
<br>Dr. Kelso and Ted the Lawyer are walking through.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Ted, I need you to crunch the numbers on next year's budget.
<br>Lawyer:  Sir, that would be a job for the accounting department -- I'm an attorney.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Uh-huh, and speaking of crunching, I have been jonesing for some Double-Stuff Oreos all day.  Why don't you see if you can't hook me up?
<br>They part ways at the Nurses' Station, where J.D. and Dr. Cox are conferring.
<br>J.D.:  ...And now, Mr. Mueller's doing so much better, I'm not even sure telling him the truth about his pancreatic cancer is even the best thing for him.
<br>Dr. Cox:  So, what you're saying is that you have a problem that is totally your problem, but you'd like to find a way to make that problem my problem.  But here's the problem, Newbie: it's not my problem.  So whatta you say we stop talking about the Janitor's junk; I'd like to hear nahsing about ze German; and don't even mention Tasty Coma Wife, even though I know she's on your mind.
<br>J.D.:  No she's not!
<br>***Fantasy:  Jamie is on J.D.'s back.
<br>Jamie:  Yes I am!
<br>J.D. throws her off.
<br>Jamie:  Waaagh!
<br>****
<br>Dr. Cox:  Well, since we are sharing:  I have to go home and face Jordan and tell her that I didn't ditch her little hatchling on account of being lazy -- I did it because, whenever I'm alone with that child, do you know what I feel?  Nothing.
<br>So whatta you say, you wanna--you wanna trade your big problems for mine?
<br>J.D.:  No thanks.
<br>Dr. Cox:  It was worth a try.
<br>He leaves.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  What was that about?
<br>J.D. gives her a look.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  You're right, I'm sorry!  I've been working really hard the past few months on not being such a busy-body.
<br>On the other side of the station, Carla is giving Turk the what-for.
<br>Carla:  So, tell me, Turk, was she a good kisser?
<br>Turk:  Uhhh....
<br>Nurse Roberts:  [to J.D.]  Excuse me.
<br>She pushes her chair over to be closer to where Turk and Carla are having their argument.
<br>Carla:  Turk!  If you're already having dreams about another woman, maybe you're not ready for marriage!
<br>She takes off her ring and holds it out to him.
<br>Turk:  Baby....
<br>Carla:  Just take it!
<br>He reaches for the ring, and she snatches it away.
<br>Carla:  Are you crazy!?  Baby, it was only a sex dream!  Everybody has them...
<br>She turns around to find someone to back her up.  She sees the Lawyer.
<br>Carla:  ...right, Ted?
<br>Lawyer:  Oh, no, not me...I just have the one dream over and over -- I hold his head under the water 'til that last bubble goes "bloop."
<br>Dr. Kelso passes through.
<br>Dr. Kelso:  Ted!  What's the E.T.A. on those Double-Stuffs?
<br>Lawyer:  Bloop.
</p><p><br>Exam Room
<br>J.D. has finished checking the Janitor's...uh..."junk."
<br>J.D.:  Okay.  Uh, I still want to refer you to a dermatologist, but it looks benign to me.
<br>Janitor:  [looking down]  Benign...be nine and a half....
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  And then he said something I never expected to hear.
<br>Janitor:  I don't like you.
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  Not that -- I totally expected that.
<br>Janitor:  ...But, I know this was uncomfortable, and, uh, I appreciate your concern.
<br>He pats J.D. on the shoulder.
<br>J.D.:  I'm a doctor.  I had to tell you what was going on.
<br>He pats the Janitor on the shoulder.
<br>Janitor:  Don't touch me with those hands.
</p><p><br>Doctor's Lounge
<br>Turk and Elliot are sitting side-by-side on one of the couches, watching TV.
<br>Elliot:  This is awkward.
<br>Turk:  Yeah, Elliot, could you, uh, be quiet please?
<br>Elliot:  Okay.  But if it gets too quiet, you could just fall asleep, and then I might just creep into your head and rock your world!  Unh!
<br>Turk:  Elliot, you don't get it, do you?  Look, ever since I met Carla, I haven't dreamt about another woman.
<br>Elliot:  Turk!  You're engaged.  I mean, it's a huge commitment!  It's totally natural to feel trapped or uncertain...maybe even a little scared?
<br>Turk:  Really?
<br>Nurse Roberts is sitting outside the door.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Uh-huh.
<br>They look over at her.
<br>Nurse Roberts:  Sorry.
<br>She pushes her chair back, away from the door.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Turk and J.D.'s Apartment -- Turk's Bedroom -- Night
<br>Turk stares at the ceiling, while Carla is almost falling asleep.
<br>Turk:  Baby?
<br>Carla:  Yeah?
<br>Turk:  Have you dreamt of anyone since we got engaged?
<br>Carla:  No, Baby, but I understand.  Come here, let me give you something to dream about.
<br>She turns over to him....
<br>*** But in his place is Ted the Lawyer.
<br>Lawyer:  See if you can find my tattoo!
<br>Startled, she bolts up.
<br>****
<br>Next to her, Turk is sound asleep.
</p><p><br>Dr. Cox's Apartment
<br>Jordan is on the couch with the baby.  Dr. Cox comes home.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Hey, Jordan.
<br>Jordan:  You know, it's funny -- I can't even be pissed and want you to die, screaming in agony, as two horses pull you apart when I'm looking at this beautiful face.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Jordan, I gotta...I gotta tell you something.
<br>He sits down on the couch next to her.
<br>Jordan:  You know, I love my dad, but he just doesn't look like a "Quinn."
<br>Dr. Cox:  Maybe that's because he's not drunk and yelling at your mother.
<br>Jordan:  What are you?  A "Kevin"?  A "Billy"?
<br>Dr. Cox:  Jack?
<br>The baby smiles.
<br>Jordan:  Wow.  All right.  Jack it is.  What the hell!  All right, you take him.
<br>She hands the baby over to Dr. Cox and gets up.
<br>Jordan:  So, what did you want to tell me?
<br>He doesn't answer for a moment, as he and the baby look at each other.
<br>There's finally a connection.
<br>Dr. Cox:  Nothing....  Nothing.
</p><p><br>Mr. Mueller's Room
<br>Elliot and J.D. are with Mr. Mueller.
<br>Elliot:  &lt;A name title="Even though it's gotten better, you still have to be aware of the severity/seriousness of your situation."&gt;Obwohl es sich schon so gebessert hat, sollten sie sich trotzdem bewusst sein, wie ernst ihre Lage ist.&lt;/A&gt;
<br>Mr. Mueller:  &lt;A name title="Then why did my brother lie to me?"&gt;Also, warum hat mein Bruder mir verlügt?&lt;/A&gt;
<br>Elliot:  He wants to know why his brother lied to him.
<br>J.D.:  Uh...I guess he was trying to protect you.  Or maybe he thought he was trying to protect you, but he was actually protecting himself.
<br>Elliot:  Hang on, I forgot what "protect" is, and you used it, like, five times. [thinks]  &lt;A name title="He probably wanted to protect you from it."&gt;Er wollte sie bestimmt...davor schützen.&lt;/A&gt;
<br>J.D.:  "...Davor schützen..." 
<br>Mr. Mueller:  So ist mein Bruder...
<br>Elliot:  [translating]  "Just like my brother..."
<br>Mr. Mueller:  ...denkt immer, er weiß was besser für mich ist.
<br>Elliot:  "...always thinking he knows what's best for me."
<br>J.D.'s Narration:  It's funny how one person can lead you to another.  I mean, I knew Mr. Mueller's brother shouldn't have tried to protect him, and yet I was doing the same thing to someone else.
<br>Cut to...
<br>Restaurant
<br>J.D. enters and approaches a table where Jamie is eating with a couple.
<br>J.D.:  Excuse me, Jamie?
<br>Jamie:  J.D.?  Wha--?
<br>J.D.:  I treated a patient today who was mad at his brother for presuming to know what's best for him.  And that got me thinking.  Because I was freaking out that we hooked up in the closet at the funeral, I did the same thing to you!  So...if you're really ready, let's go for it!  'Cause, I'm crazy about you, and you're right -- your husband's gone, and he's never coming back!
<br>Man:  Uhh.
<br>J.D.:  Who are these lovely people?
<br>Jamie:  These are my late husband's parents.
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  Oh, God.  How can I make this right?
<br>***Fantasy Sequence:  The restaurant is filled with red balloons, and J.D., Jamie, and her former in-laws happily dance to "99 Luftballons".
<br>****
<br>J.D.'s Thoughts:  If only....
