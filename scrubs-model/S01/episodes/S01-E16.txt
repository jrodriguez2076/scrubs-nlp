<p>The following is a transcript of the <i><a href="/wiki/Scrubs" title="Scrubs">Scrubs</a></i> episode <b>"<a href="/wiki/My_Heavy_Meddle" title="My Heavy Meddle">My Heavy Meddle</a>"</b>.
</p>Contents<p>Open -- Hospital
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: When you're a doctor you need to be prepared for anything.
Heart attacks, drug overdoses, gunshot wounds, but one thing you can't
prepare for is what happens after you break up with a co-worker.
</p><p>J.D. bumps into Elliot
</p><p>J.D.: Watch where you're walking!
</p><p>Elliot: You watch where you're walking.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Don't let her get the last word.
</p><p>J.D.: [shouting down the hall] Just... You watch where you're walking.
</p><p>Elliot: [from down the hall] You watch where you're walking!
</p><p>J.D.: Damn!
</p><p>Another time, J.D.'s wearing different colored scrubs denoting a passage of
time
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Try as hard as you can to avoid them, you're bound to run
into them one day.
</p><p>J.D. and Elliot see and then avoid each other in the hospital hallway
</p><p>J.D. and Elliot see each other at the nurse's station
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: And the next day...
</p><p>J.D. and Elliot are at adjacent batting cages. Elliot sees J.D.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: And the next day.
</p><p>J.D.: You don't even play sports.
</p><p>Elliot: It so happens, this helps me to relieve stress.
</p><p>She takes a swing and misses. J.D. laughs.
</p><p>J.D.: Feel better?
</p><p>A ball hits him in the head and he falls. Elliot laughs
</p><p>Elliot: I do now.
</p><p>A ball hits her in the head and knocks her down
</p><p>At the Hospital
The Janitor approaches J.D., who is looking at a chart
</p><p>Janitor: Girl problems?
</p><p>J.D.: How'd you know?
</p><p>Janitor: You look like you got problems. You're a girl. Hence, girl
problems. Watch your nails.
</p><p>He slams the door of the nurse's station, which hits where J.D.'s hand was
before he moved it
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: I guess the only positive is that our hospital is like one
big family. So if one relationship ends, there are always plenty of others
around that you can rely on.
</p><p>Cox walks in
</p><p>J.D.: Dr. Cox, I was wondering-
</p><p>Dr. Cox: I'd say you're about a B-cup. [looking at J.D.'s chest] Yeah.
</p><p>Cox walks away, and the camera lands on the Janitor
</p><p>Janitor: At least they're real.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Yep, it's a good place to heal.
</p><p>OPENING THEME
COMMERCIAL
</p><p>J.D. and Turk's apartment
</p><p>J.D.: [on the phone] Look Mom, I gotta go. [pause] He did. [pause] Wow.
[pause] Yeah, alright, I love you too, bye.
</p><p>He hangs up the phone
</p><p>J.D.: My high school teacher Mr. Peters died. He was a great guy.
</p><p>Turk: You okay?
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Even though I see death all the time now, I still react the
exact same way I did when I was a kid.
</p><p>J.D.: Doin' a lot better than Mr. Peters. [smiles]
</p><p>Turk: Dude!
</p><p>The Hospital
Cox walks through a door
</p><p>Dr. Cox: 'Sup, Newbie?
</p><p>J.D.: My mom called and said my favorite high school teacher just died.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Yeah, the correct answer to that question is 'Nothing, Sir.'
</p><p>Looks into a room
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh. My. God. Would you look at this hellhole? If I have to see
one more broken down piece of equipment, one more gomer who is shuffled back
and forth between some godforsaken home, one more patient who is denied
treatment because they got the wrong insurance, I... There are times when
I'm all by myself, and I concentrate as hard as I can to see if I can't make
myself catch on fire like the human torch. And mark my words, Newbie, if I
ever pull it off, I will be back here to destroy this place.
</p><p>He stops in the doorway of a room
</p><p>J.D.: I used to like the Silver Surfer.
</p><p>Makes a surfing motion
</p><p>J.D.: Hang ten! Hang...
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Get in here.
</p><p>They walk into the room
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: I guess after a while you get used to Dr. Cox's rants.
</p><p>Dr. Cox: And of course the lab tech is nowhere to be found, so I can't get
that tox-screen I was looking for. [picking up a pad] What do you say we
write him a friendly note, shall we? 'Dear Incompetent Dumbass...(Pencil lead breaks) 
</p><p>Cox stops writing
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: The truth is that Dr. Cox isn't really angry. He's just
amusing himself.
</p><p>Cox shoves the computer off the lab tech's desk
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Okay, maybe he's a little angry.
</p><p>Cox pushes a counter-full of supplies onto the ground
</p><p>J.D.: [mumbling] We didn't need those... so... all done?
</p><p>Cox picks up a stool and throws it through a window to another lab. The lab
techs inside run for cover and poke their heads up after the glass settles.
</p><p>J.D.: [through the window] He broke his pencil...
</p><p>More crashes are heard off-screen and things fly behind J.D.
</p><p>J.D. and Turk's apartment
Elliot is sitting on the couch with books in her hand, and Turk is in the
kitchen area
</p><p>Elliot: Turk, you are going to be so happy you picked me to co-write this
study.
</p><p>She is piling books up on the table
</p><p>Turk: Hell yeah. I thought we'd start off by having a couple of beers.
</p><p>Elliot: [she scoffs] Uh, yeah. I got all the info I could find on
peripheral vascular disease, and then I highlighted the important passages
and color-coded them to correspond with the outline on the back of your
packet.
</p><p>Turk: But I don't have a packet.
</p><p>Elliot whips out a packet
</p><p>Turk: Look at that, Turk's packet. So you did this last night.
</p><p>Elliot: Yeah. Why? What'd you do?
</p><p>Turk: Well, Carla had to work, so I scarfed down a bunch of fast food,
right, and I got back home at around 7 o'clock. I went to the bathroom at
about 8. I got out of there at 11:15. It was a good night.
</p><p>Elliot: I'm a nervous poo-er.
</p><p>J.D.: Yo, you are not going to believe what Dr. Cox...
</p><p>He sees Elliot
</p><p>J.D.: It's you.
</p><p>Elliot: Yeah. It's me.
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: Ugh. Could Turk have picked anyone worse to be doing this
project with?
</p><p>glasses
</p><p>Janitor: If this is a peripheral vascular disease study, they might find it
essential to exclude all clottication patients not currently on
pentoxyphylline. What are you looking at?!
</p><p>J.D.: Uh, I'm going to go to bed.
</p><p>Turk: Elliot, are you going to go with him?
</p><p>Turk: It's too early for jokes, huh? That's good to know. It's good to
know.
</p><p>Hospital
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Interesting. It isn't often I'm paged by a nurse. As a matter
of fact, the last time was when... oh, what was her name? She hasn't
worked here since then. Oh never mind, what can I do for you and your coma
patient here?
</p><p>Carla: Well, I came across Mr. Rice's advanced directive, and he has a few
requests he would like us to honor.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Let's see. Blinds open. That's done. Incense burning. Close
enough. Glad you called.
</p><p>Carla: Dr. Kelso? He also wants to hear Poison's 'Talk Dirty to Me' once a
day.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: He wants to hear whose what?
</p><p>Carla: Poison. It's a heavy metal band.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Oh, like Motley Crue, and Winger. My son was a bit of a
headbanger.
</p><p>Carla: I'll get a tape-deck in here and we'll just...
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: Miss Espinoza, that's not necessary.
</p><p>Carla: It's just one song.
</p><p>Dr. Kelso: It's starts out as just one song, but then before you know it,
half of the hospital staff is running around piercing their genitalia, and
fornicating in the back of vans. Unless a family member shows up to enforce
the directive, we really don't have to do anything. Now, will you do me a
favor, and just forget about it, sweetheart?
</p><p>Carla: Of course.
</p><p>Another part of the Hospital
Carla is talking to Ted
</p><p>Carla: So do you think you can help me locate one of his family members?
</p><p>Ted: I guess I could try to locate one through some legal channels, but I'm
really swamped.
</p><p>Carla: You know, I love your worry lines. They're so adorable, they're like
sexy little forehead smiles.
</p><p>Ted: Careful, I've been hurt before.
</p><p>Ted walks away and J.D. walks up to the nurse's station
</p><p>J.D.: You are not going to believe what happened yesterday. Dr. Cox just
went ballistic and destroyed an entire lab room.
</p><p>Laverne and Carla look at each other
</p><p>J.D.: Oh yeah. Broken computers, chairs through windows, shattered beakers.
Beakers, people, beakers. How is this not good gossip?
</p><p>Carla: J.D., he does this year. And whatever you do, don't get caught in
his wake, because if you do, he's taking you down.
</p><p>Laverne: Downtown.
</p><p>J.D.: [nervously] All the way?
</p><p>J.D. and Turk's Apartment
J.D., in his pajamas, is brushing his teeth when he hears knocking
</p><p>J.D.: [to Rowdy] Okay boy. [louder] Who is it?
</p><p>The knocking continues. J.D. looks out the peephole and gasps loudly
</p><p>Dr. Cox: [through the peephole] Listen up, little piggy. You open up this
door in the next three seconds or I will start huffing and puffing.
</p><p>Cox starts blowing
</p><p>J.D.: But Dr. Cox, I...
</p><p>Cox starts counting with his fingers
</p><p>J.D.: Okay! Okay!
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Oh dear lord, please tell me that's not a onesie.
</p><p>J.D.: Look, Dr. Cox, I'd invite you in, but I...
</p><p>Dr. Cox: Marcia, I have no interest in coming in.
</p><p>J.D.: Oh thank God.
</p><p>Cox grabs J.D. and yanks him out the doorway
</p><p>Dr. Cox: We're going out.
</p><p>The Hospital On-Call Room
Elliot and Turk are working on their project
</p><p>Elliot: Okay, we can finish the synopsis for chapter four and process the
Stegman data if we pull an all-nighter.
</p><p>Turk: Elliot, this isn't due for another month.
</p><p>Elliot: Yeah, but if we finish one week early we can just sit back and play
with the fonts and margins.
</p><p>Turk: [scared] Oh, whoo... Tonight's date night with Carla, and I got on
special underwear.
</p><p>Elliot: Go. Do you mind if I keep working?
</p><p>Turk: Yeah, that works for me.
</p><p>The Todd sits up from the couch where he was lying unseen
</p><p>Todd: I'm wearing special underwear too. [whispering] They're invisible.
</p><p>Elliot: Yeah, I get it Todd, I'm just kind of busy here.
</p><p>Todd: Oh, no time for the Todd. All the project geeks are busy working
tonight.
</p><p>He lies back down on the couch
</p><p>Elliot: Excuse me?
</p><p>Todd gets back up
</p><p>Todd: All the surgical interns pick a project geek from medical to write our
reports for us.
</p><p>Elliot: [pointing at herself with a pen] I'm not a geek.
</p><p>Todd: What's that on your finger?
</p><p>Elliot: [putting down her pen and looking at her index finger] It's a
rubber thingie that I wear to help me turn the pages... [realization
arrives] quicker...
</p><p>Todd lies back down, laughing
</p><p>Todd: She said rubber thingie.
</p><p>Nurse's Station
Turk jumps up onto the counter in front of Carla
</p><p>Carla: [on the phone] Thank you.
</p><p>Turk: Excuse me, nurse. I'm ready for my sponge bath.
</p><p>Carla: Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry, I can't. I gotta go pick up a CD for this
coma patient of mine.
</p><p>Turk: But I'm wearing silk boxers.
</p><p>Carla: Turk...
</p><p>Turk: They're the ones with the little dogs holding the big money bags.
</p><p>Carla: Sweetie, I love your money pants, I do. It's just that I really feel
somebody needs to take care of this guy.
</p><p>Turk: How is it that you can blow me off, and it just makes you seem sexier?
</p><p>Carla: [smiling] Cause you're whipped.
</p><p>Turk: I thought so.
</p><p>They kiss
</p><p>Carla: Thank you.
</p><p>A Bar
J.D. just finished rinsing his toothbrush in a shot glass; he takes a sip
</p><p>J.D.: Ah, minty.
</p><p>He puts the toothbrush in his mouth, which gets a look from Cox
</p><p>J.D.: Okay, so we're here. What do you want to talk about?
</p><p>Cox: Laura, if you don't toss that shot back, I'm going to throw you up on
the bar and make you sing the theme song from 'Endless Love'.
</p><p>J.D. drinks
</p><p>J.D.: Ah, yucky.
</p><p>Cox: Yucky?
</p><p>J.D.: Yucky.
</p><p>Cox: My god, I'm drinking with a mouseketeer. [to bartender] Two more.
</p><p>J.D.: So if you're not going to talk to me, what's the point of sitting here
alone at the bar?
</p><p>Cox: You know, it's a good point. It is [he turns behind them to a table
with two women] Excuse me, ladies? Do you know anybody who might like to
have a couple of free drinks?
</p><p>The girls approach them, while J.D. turns back and furiously brushes his
teeth; he turns back when they get to the bar
</p><p>J.D.: Hello, ladies. [he gets off his barstool and leans his arm against a
pole] Oh yes, it's a onesie.
</p><p>On-Call Room
Turk rushes in
</p><p>Turk: Great news, Elliot. I'm back for the night.
</p><p>Elliot: [putting on her backpack] You know what? To hell with you, Chris
Turk. [she bumps into him roughly on her way out]
</p><p>Turk: What the hell got into her?
</p><p>Todd rises from the couch
</p><p>Todd: Wazzaaaaaap? Ha ha ha!
</p><p>Mr. Rice's room
A boombox is playing Poison's 'Talk Dirty to Me'; Kelso walks in
</p><p>Kelso: Could you turn that up please?
</p><p>Carla: What?
</p><p>Kelso: [turning off the music] I thought I told you not to play that in the
house-uh, hospital.
</p><p>Carla: Well, I'm just trying to do right by my patient.
</p><p>Kelso: Well, as of this moment, he is no longer your patient.
</p><p>Carla: Dr. Kelso, you-
</p><p>Kelso: Young lady, when I asked you to leave it alone, I wasn't really
asking you. It's like when I ask the paper boy to avoid hitting my
rosebushes. I'm not leaving it up him. I'm saying, 'You damn well better
do it, or I'm going to forget to put the chain on Baxter.' Now get on out
of here, and take that boomblaster with you.
</p><p>Bar
</p><p>Girl: My relationship with Jeremy was emotionally over long before he ended
it.
</p><p>echoed.
</p><p>Girl: Then I graduated from college and right away I met Ethan.
</p><p>J.D. is pulling on a noose
</p><p>J.D.: You don't say. Huh!
</p><p>Girl: We had two good years, and two bad years. But not all at once.
</p><p>J.D. now has his neck in the loop and is tightening
</p><p>J.D.: Oh, yeah, of course.
</p><p>J.D.: Look, Dr. Cox. Don't get me wrong, I love getting drunk in my jammies
just as much as the next guy, but it's late, so...
</p><p>Cox: Thanks for coming out, there, Newbie. Hope this whole thing wasn't too
yucky for you. [he drinks]
</p><p>J.D.: Well. You seem fine, so...
</p><p>Cox turns around
</p><p>Cox: I'm not fine. I mean, why do you think we're out here at this bar at 2
o'clock in the morning? So we can go in the urinal and piss on the ice?
</p><p>J.D.: I love to melt the middle.
</p><p>Cox: We're out here because if I go home and go to sleep, the only thing I'm
going to be able to think about is that I gotta get up tomorrow morning and
go back to that place. You wanna know something, pal? I got nothing.
Honest to God, I got nothing. I'm cooked.
</p><p>He takes one last drink and leaves
</p><p>Bartender: And you owe me $53.
</p><p>J.D.: I, uh, think I left my wallet in my other onesie.
</p><p>COMMERCIAL
</p><p>Hospital
</p><p>Carla: So the bartender just let you skip out on the tab?
</p><p>J.D.: He said I could pay him back by giving him a complete physical, which
is actually scary because I never mentioned I was a doctor.
</p><p>Carla: Bambi, I warned you about getting caught up in Dr. Cox's wake. [to
Laverne] But does he listen?
</p><p>Laverne: You'd think so, with those ears.
</p><p>J.D.: Uncalled for, okay? Listen, it's different this time. He showed up
at my place.
</p><p>Carla: He's showed up at my house before.
</p><p>Laverne: Showed up at my momma's on Mother's Day.
</p><p>Ted: [as he's walking by] Ruined my wedding.
</p><p>J.D.: You know, what? I know that you guys think he's just going to shake
all this off and be fine, but I'm telling you, I connected with the guy.
And there's no way in hell he's just going to walk through this door and
have a big smile on his face.
</p><p>Cox walks in with a big smile on his face
</p><p>Cox: Woohoo! What do you say, sports fans? [with a Scottish accent] It's
a great day!
</p><p>Cafeteria
</p><p>Turk: Elliot, Todd has something to say to you. Todd?
</p><p>Todd: Turk never told me you were his project geek.
</p><p>Turk: And?
</p><p>Todd: You look really hot eating that egg.
</p><p>Turk pushes Todd
</p><p>Todd: Oh, um. I'm sorry. Okay? Are we? [he raises his hand for a high
five]
</p><p>Turk: No. [he sits down across from Elliot and Todd leaves]
</p><p>Elliot: Look me in the eyes and tell me I'm not a geek.
</p><p>Turk: Come on! You still got that rubber thingie on your finger!
</p><p>Elliot: [defensively] Eggs can be extremely slippery!
</p><p>Outside Mr. Rice's Room
Ted taps Carla on the shoulder, startling her
</p><p>Carla: You scared the hell out of me.
</p><p>Ted: I'm sorry, that always happens. No one ever expects me to be anywhere.
</p><p>Carla: Aw, Ted. [she leaves]
</p><p>Ted: She knows your name. [he follows her] So I found your coma patient's
relative you were looking for.
</p><p>Carla: Thank you! [she hugs him] Oh, thank you so much!
</p><p>Ted: [softly] Don't let go.
</p><p>Carla: [she lets go] What?
</p><p>Ted: Nothing.
</p><p>Elsewhere
</p><p>Cox: I'm willing to acknowledge that there have been occasions during my
tenure here when my enthusiasm...
</p><p>J.D.: What the hell do you think you're doing?
</p><p>Cox: Now, I'm apologizing to Franklin here for breaking his favorite
microscope.
</p><p>J.D.: No, see, you can't just drag me out of the house in the middle of the
night, cry on my shoulder, and then pretend like nothing happened.
</p><p>Cox: Alllllright, first of all, Franklin, there was no crying. [whistles at
Franklin] Say it.
</p><p>Franklin: No crying.
</p><p>Cox: Good boy. [to J.D.] And you, my little precious, should give some
thought to purchasing some non-bunching panties. They give you the extra
support you love so much, while protecting against those offensive lines
underneath your scrubs.
</p><p>J.D.: Mm, I get it, I'm a girl.
</p><p>Cox: Franklin, you heard it. Say it.
</p><p>Franklin: He's a girl.
</p><p>Cox: Good boy.
</p><p>J.D.: You can't go around playing with people's emotions cause you feel like
it.
</p><p>Cox: Okay Newbie. I'm now going to give you an opportunity to get the hell
out of here before I grab you by your ankles and redecorate Franklin's lab!
</p><p>Franklin: Please go.
</p><p>J.D. and Turk's Apartment
</p><p>Turk: We're back! The clique is back together!
</p><p>Elliot: Mmhmm, that is what I'm talking about. Shall we?
</p><p>Turk: Let's do this.
</p><p>Elaborate handshake and dance
</p><p>Elliot: Okay, let's get back to work. Okay, but it's going to be different
this time, okay? We take a systematic approach, we can maximize our
efficiency.
</p><p>Turk: I rented 'Red Dawn'.
</p><p>Elliot: Wolverines!
</p><p>Hospital
</p><p>Carla: Dr. Kelso? This is Matthew Rice.
</p><p>Ted: He's the proxy for his uncle's living will.
</p><p>Kelso: What a happy coincidence, you showing up out of the clear blue sky.
</p><p>Ted: Oh God.
</p><p>Carla: You're okay.
</p><p>Matthew: So exactly how much is my uncle leaving me? Can I ask that?
</p><p>Carla: Oh, no, Mr. Rice. This isn't about his assets. This is about
executing his last living requests.
</p><p>Matthew: So... No money at all?
</p><p>Kelso: Not a dime, kiddo. I can't tell you how glad we are to finally put
all this tomfoolery to rest. [glaring at Carla and Ted] Once and for all!
[to Matthew] Cup of coffee, sport?
</p><p>Ted: What happened? I blacked out.
</p><p>Lab
</p><p>Cox: When you rolled out of bed this morning, did you actually say to
yourself, 'Hey. I think today would be a terrific day to commit hara-kiri.'
Because you realize, that's what you're doing.
</p><p>J.D.: I just don't think you deal with your problems the way emotionally
healthy people do.
</p><p>Cox: Well, hold on a second there Rainbow! This just off the newswire!
You're not licensed to comment on how people deal with their emotions!
</p><p>J.D.: I beg to differ.
</p><p>Cox: Well, at least I let mine go. You, if you ever were able to actually
release all the tensions that are bottled up inside you, what would that
look like? How would that go?
</p><p>Cox falls to the ground.
</p><p>J.D.: How you like me now, bitch?
</p><p>J.D.: Maybe I just don't have anything bottled up.
</p><p>Cox: Uh huh. And what happened to that schoolteacher you were prattling on
about?
</p><p>J.D.: Passed away.
</p><p>Cox: Croaksville. That's what I thought. And what was the first thing you
did when you found out that he'd died?
</p><p>J.D.: I made a joke.
</p><p>Cox: And jeepers, I sure hope it was a good one. I do, because here's the
inside scoop. Life's hard enough. And there's no way in hell you can
survive in a dump like this unless you find a way to get your emotions out.
Fact.
</p><p>J.D.: Well, I let my emotions out! I'll show you some of this! [he pushes
a beaker onto the floor; Franklin walks in hugging a microscope] Oh
Franklin, I am so sorry. [takes his stethescope off his neck] Wanna wear
my stethescope?
</p><p>Apartment
</p><p>Turk: You know what's the cool thing about this movie? That this could
really happen.
</p><p>Elliot: Which part? The Russians invading Michigan or C. Thomas Howell
being a tough guy?
</p><p>Turk: Both.
</p><p>J.D. walks in, sees the movie playing
</p><p>J.D.: [sighs] Wolverines. [to Turk] Why is she always here?
</p><p>Turk: We're working on my study.
</p><p>Elliot: You know, I'm so sick of this. I mean, every time I come here, I'm
going to see him, so just get someone else to do this stupid project with
you.
</p><p>Turk: No, look. Okay, maybe the reason why I asked you to work with me on
this is because I knew it would force you and J.D. to see each other.
</p><p>Elliot: I don't want to get back together with him.
</p><p>Turk: I'm not saying get back together, okay? You guys made a terrible
couple. It's just that I like you, you know? I think you're a cool person.
</p><p>Elliot: It doesn't matter what happens between me and J.D. I mean, you and
I can still hang out.
</p><p>Turk: No. It can't be that way and you know it. That's my best friend. So
either you can try and fix it or...
</p><p>Elliot: This sucks.
</p><p>Turk: Yeah.
</p><p>Hospital
</p><p>Carla: [singing] And baby we'll be at the drive-in
</p><p>Ted: [singing] In the old man's Ford.
</p><p>Together: [singing] Behind the bushes, til I'm screaming for more, down the
basement, lock the cellar door. And baby, talk dirty to me.
</p><p>Ted: I love you.
</p><p>Carla: What?
</p><p>Ted: [singing] Know that we'll be
</p><p>Together: [singing] At the drive-in
</p><p>On-Call Room
</p><p>Elliot: Hey. What are you doing?
</p><p>J.D.: This is an old recommendation letter from a high school teacher of
mine. He's actually the, uh, reason I got into medicine. And he died last
week.

</p><p>Elliot: Dr. Dorian, we're ready for the finale.
</p><p>J.D.: Thank you, Dr. Reid. Okay guys. One, two, three!
</p><p>J.D.'s Thoughts: It felt really good.
